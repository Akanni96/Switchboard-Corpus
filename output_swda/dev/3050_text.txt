Okay,
there we go.
Okay,
great.
So, do you play golf at all?
Yeah,
I do,
I'm a player.
I'm kind of embarrassed I'm talking to a man, cause I'm sure that you are, you play a lot more than I do.
Actually, I don't.
Oh, really.
No,
uh, I, uh, when I was younger, I played a little bit
and I was horrible,
so I just stopped playing.
Oh, well, my husband is, is a very good golfer.
He has got, like a six handicap.
Wow,
that is real good.
So, uh,
and he has been playing since we have been married for twenty two years.
So, I had to start playing because, he was, you know, such an avid golfer.
So, I have been playing now,
well I have had clubs for twenty years, you know.
Wow,
so you have been playing,
But, but, I really enjoy it.
So, I had to check that and, and, uh, talk about it.
Well, have you played recently?
No,
actually, I don't even know if I checked that or not, to be perfectly honest. Um
Oh
That seems to have been a mistake,
I don't know. Um.
Oh, that's okay.
Yeah,
I have not played in a long time.
Um, when I was,
about five or six years ago, my dad , who plays every now and then took me out with him
and, and I basically, um, I had a horrible slice or hook,
I forget which one it was.
Yeah.
It wound up tossing the ball into the trees, virtually every time.
Yeah.
Yeah,
the slice goes to the right
and the hook goes to the left,
I think.
Yes,
I was slicing, actually.
Yeah.
And, as it turns out, uh, I went and took some lessons for awhile, because I just, I would lose so many balls, and, uh, make it a horrible time for everybody.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I went and took some lessons,
and a I got a little bit better,
but I but then I sort of, you know, went, went back to school and did not have time and this and that,
and, and the only thing I do now is I occasionally go out to a driving range and hit a couple of balls and see what I can do.
And I, And I still have this slice ,
Yeah,
I think that's really a good thing to do.
So, where, are you in your life,
I mean, are you in school?
I'm a graduate student,
yeah.
Oh, okay,
at the University of Rochester?
Yes.
Oh, great.
As a matter of fact, um, so I don't have time to do much else, except for graduate work.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right,
so I hang around this way,
and I,
Sure.
Occasionally, uh, uh,
a bunch of us were pretty avid golfers. Golfers, so we will go out
Uh-huh.
and we will, we will, we will play, you know.
And you don't, you don't have the length of the playing time that we do.
I have, I have very at the moment I have very little playing time.
When I, when I go on vacation, my father and I, uh play a little bit.
Yes.
But, I don't, you know,
we play a par, a par three, nine hole course.
Because, .
Oh, that's my favorite kind to play.
Because, for a woman, it's really nice to play a par three course because, that's my, I can't hit a driver very far
Yeah.
and, in fact, I don't even like to use a driver,
I use a three iron off the tee because, I have more control over it.
Um.
Uh-huh.
And, I can, I can just have better contact with the ball that way.
So, I'm still using a three iron
and my husband is trying to get me into using a, you, know, like a high number wood instead.
Right.
But, those are, uh, still not you favorite, huh?
No,
it's not my favorite,
but, I, I, uh, I enjoy,
I, I really do,
I think I'm going to like golf the older I get, and the more time I have to play.
I, we have three teenage daughters.
Uh, wow, .
One is,
You must be very busy.
Yeah,
I'm very busy,
I have a part time job
and, and during the year, I don't play much golf
but, but, when I'm, we are on vacation, I love to play. Just like you said.
Um.
And, we got to play in Monterrey in California, right, you know, along the Pacific Ocean, this past spring.
And that was, I told my husband, that was the way to play, you know,
that was,
if I could play there every time I want, it was, it was great.
A neat experience
Miniature golf, there's my game. Uh.
Miniature golf is great,
yes.
Miniature golf, there you go, putt, putt.
Well, that's the thing my kids like to do that with, you know, on dates and stuff.
Uh.
But, golf is um,
we, we probably are talking about golf because I did check it You know .
I don't, I don't, I don't
I may have, actually, I may have just checked random things.
I don't, I don't recall anymore.
Well, yeah,
if you ever played,
I mean, I feel like anybody that's ever played golf can talk about it
and maybe if you can even talk about it, if you, if you have, uh, watched it on T V.
Right.
Yeah,
actually, we have a very very, um,
we had the, uh,
Yeah,
tell me about your clubs up there.
What,
Well, we had,
I haven't played around here too much.
We have a very good one called Locust Hill though.
There, uh, the
Locust Hill?
Yeah,
the L P G A comes here every year the Rochester International.
Uh-huh,
right.
And then we had a P G A, actually, a very big P G A, uh, tour stop here, last year.
Oh, great.
And, actually, um, they say the, the,
I have not played the course,
but, they say the course is very, is, is, is pretty tough, pretty challenging.
Uh-huh.
And it's, um, not only that,
but, it's exceedingly well kept, apparently.
Oh, yeah.
Because, those are the comments I kept hearing from the pros, you know,
they kept saying, we hear, you know, on, on television I,
but, they keep saying it's just wonderful, uh,
the course is so well maintained
and, you know, it, it, it rained through half the um, tournament, so people had to ,
but, they still,
the grounds keepers were absolutely wonderful about, getting things back up again.
Oh, yeah.
And this,
actually, when, when the, um, when the L P G A came here I guess that was about a week and a half ago, it was just, it, it takes over the whole town.
Uh-huh.
Oh, sure.
You know.  It's all over the news,
and lots and lots of people take off work, to go to go an watch the, the, uh, ladies like some loss of words play.
Yes.
Yeah.
To watch them,
yeah.
The ladies,
So, I mean, I think it's actually, it's absolutely wonderful to see.
Yeah,
I'm sure the people love golf up there like they do down here.
Yeah,
uh.
People are just
golf is just,
it's just the coming thing,
I mean a lot of people are just crazy about it.
It seems to be.
It seems a lot of people are really, you know,
either, um, either you have not played it, or, or you, you have played it
and you sort of stink, like me,
Well, it's, it's just such a difficult thing.
and you sort of play every now and then.
I mean it's, I just, I watch my husband
and he's, he was a professional athlete,
he, he's a very good athlete
and he's got the coordination, that God given coordination,
and he just struggles, you know, all the time, to um, to master this game.
Yeah.
Yeah,
well, same here, I mean, I'm a brown belt in Karate at this point in time.
And, uh, And, and I can not, and I can not hit a golf ball
Oh my, really!
Yeah.
You know I,
Because it,
well, I watch my husband swing
and his swing, you know, like compared to the pros, is so, it's ridged.
It's like he's trying so hard, it's not that flowing movement. You know.
Right.
That's because he's probably doing what I do, worrying about, is my head straight, is my arm right,
Yeah.
Yeah.
Or, how far he's going to hit it, I think, you know.
oh yeah.
And I worry about that.
Oh, yeah.
I have just got to get this drive, you know, really far,
I have got to hit it.
Yeah.
So.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I have this nasty habit of of turning my head at the last second, or, or just keeping my arm wrong.
Yep,
or,
Yeah,
turning your head is probably the most common thing for women, they say.
Is it?
And you are always so anxious to see where it goes.
Right,
exactly.
Uh-huh.
Exactly,
It's just like I, I don't watch the ball die,
I have .
It took me a long time to learn to wait until the ball was in the air before I looked up.
Yeah,
yeah,
I have to that, especially, even more so, with a short iron than a long you know, than with a driver or something.
Oh, driver.
Because, those short irons, it's just, you want to look up cause you are getting close to the green
Yeah.
and you want to see it hit the green.
And you know that's why,
Watch where it's going.
Yeah,
so. I I don't know what I'm supposed to ask questions about,
That, that is certainly true
thank you .
am I supposed to ask questions about this whole procedure,
I know that.
That's okay,
go ahead,
it's no big deal.
Well, uh,  when I,
do you get, get, um, reimbursed for the calls you make or the calls you talk on too?
Both.
Both.
Okay.
I believe so.
Okay,
well I really did not know  so I,
I, I,  I actually don't know,
I get a random reimbursement every now and then and don't really don't really figure it out,  until  afterward
Yeah.
Okay.
Cause this is only my second day doing it
and I just did not, I did not know
and that was .  the details,
Oh,  really.
we, I just started yesterday.
I have been doing this for awhile, actually.
Have you?
It seems like it's been a while.
Yeah.
And they just,  I just,  get these random checks in the mail every now and then
I had a ,
and,
I see.
My wife and I both do it, as a matter of fact.
I see.
And we both just, sort of, get these random checks in the mail
and, To be honest, I, I really have not been accounting,
Yeah.
I just sort of figured, well, it's going to work.
Uh-huh.
You know, if it works, it works.
So ,
Well, my, uh,

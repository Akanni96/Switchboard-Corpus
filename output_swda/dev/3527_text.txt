Okay,
do, do you have a home, or apartment?
Uh-huh,
I have a home.
Okay,
do you have to do a lot of upkeep?
Not really,
we have a small backyard and small front yard
Uh-huh.
but, uh, uh, I do basically like the shrubbery and the planting and the weeding
and he mows the lawn because the lawn mower is too heavy
That's another story.
Okay
And, uh, and, uh, I do the edging and stuff like that,
but, uh, it doesn't take us that long because our, our yard is so small.
Uh-huh.
But, uh, I try and do as much, you know flowering as I can, and that kind of stuff. The seasonal things.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
uh-huh.
But, uh, I think we have one of the nicest yards in the, in the neighborhood
Well, that's nice
I wish I could say that.
Ours is pretty small, too,
but it, it takes about an hour with the two of us working to, you know, do the bushes and all of that sort of thing.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Uh, the worst part is controlling the weeds. Which I hate because we don't like to use a lot of the chemicals and, because, like, we have a dog and, and, you know, he's going to be out in the yard and who knows who he eats out there.
Oh, yeah.
That's true.
But we try not to use them but we end up using some anyway.
Uh um, what else.
I get to put out all the Christmas lights out there and all that, sort of thing
I don't
No?
No,
he does that.
Oh, okay.
Well, if they, if they go up
like, one year we did the edge of the house all the way up on the roof
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
and I I went up on the roof once and I'll never do it again
I decided I was afraid
Yeah.
Don't blame you
So this year, he got lazy so I said, fine
I'll put some on the bushes.
And that's about it,
that's all it gets.
Yeah.
Huh, okay,
we don't have that many bushes to put them on.
Uh, our, our yard is very, uh, narrow
Uh-huh.
and so we have some bushes, but we don't have too many,
but we have a nice tree in the front
and uh, we have people that, an association that comes and mows everybody's front yard
Uh-huh.
Oh, wow.
and, uh, they keep hitting it, the tree with the lawn mower.
Oh, no.
You know, every time you do that, it, uh, kind of kills the tree for a while.
Yeah.
And so that's kind of stunt its growth for just a while until we get it back going again.
Oh.
And we started mowing our own lawn
Uh-huh.
because they were doing that.
And so, anyways I have a nice full tree now
and, and we put , we fill it with lights and that kind of thing.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
So,
Um. But you still have to pay for it, though, even though they're not going to do it?
And they would, uh, they also edged,
when they would edge in, into the shrubbery and oh, gosh, it was getting really bad,
so we,
Yeah,
because it's an association fee.
Oh, is it real expensive?
Yes
Oh, gosh.
it's like seventy a month.
Oh, my goodness.
Yeah,
and I don't like,
I, I just get really upset every time I make that check out.
Yeah.
But, uh,
Well, do, do they do other things for you all?
They take care of the, uh, landscape,
because we live in a cul-de-sac
and there is a island in the middle
Uh-huh.
so they care of that
and there is a pool and they take care of the pool
Uh-huh.
and, and there is a pond,
they take care of the pond in the park area and that kind of thing.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, so you're basically paying, oh,
and the sprinkler system that,
that
our yard doesn't have a sprinkler system, but the island does
and, uh certain sharing areas have sprinkler systems
Uh-huh.
and and so that way if someone moves out, the entire neighborhood is mowed and watered and that kind of thing, you know.
Uh-huh.
Um.
So,
But you knew when you moved in, you'd have to pay that, didn't you?
Well, it, it, it went up what we pay.
Oh
And that's the bad thing.
I just hope it doesn't go up any more
because we just can't afford it anymore.
Yeah.
I don't know what to do if you can't afford it
I don't know either.
That's interesting.
So, uh, but, they're,
that's what they do.
They take care of basically the front yards and unless you don't want them to do it.
Uh-huh.
Now do at a
do things like plant bushes and trees?
They,
only in, like, in the common areas and in the island.
Oh, okay.
But they don't do it in your yard.
So, there is, like, no restriction on what types of bushes you can have or anything like that?
Right,
uh-huh,
yeah,
so we've added bushes and, and shrubbery, too.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
when we moved into our house I just hated the bushes they had.
I, I ripped most of them out and put them somewhere in the back.
I know.
And put new ones out front.
But that was a lot of work.
Yeah.
Took me a long time.
Yeah,
that's what we did when we first moved in, too.
Uh-huh.
Just rearranged some things
Yeah,
and then, then we put in a sprinkler system,
and, We won't go through that again,
Oh.
I will pay someone to do it
Oh, really?
Oh, it took so long.
Oh.
Because my husband was, you know, digging the trenches because he didn't want to get a trencher, you know,
there is a machine that will do it.
Oh, yeah.
Because, you know, there is so many people that broke either their water main or their gas main doing it.
And I guess that costs you an absolute fortune.
Oh.
That's true,
so gosh,
you did it manually.
By hand.
Oh.
Oh, gosh.
Yeah,
but it works great now that we've got it.
I bet.
Yeah,
it's nice.
Yeah,
that's a good investment there.
Yeah,
well, we needed to because we're having some foundation trouble,
you know, you have to keep the, the area moist around the house or it makes it worse,
Oh.
so, we had an incentive there to do that.
Oh.

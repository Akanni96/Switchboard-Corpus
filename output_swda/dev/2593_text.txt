So, the, the topic is hobbies
In your spare time.
Yeah.
Who has spare time
Um, I don't really, don't really do any handicraft things like that.
I used to. I used to do, like salt ornaments and things.
Uh-huh.
But that was, oh, good many, many years ago
and I have, I really, my spare time
Yeah.
I usually go do aerobics and read,
and that's,  about  it
Yeah.
Yeah.
I understood that.
I'm, you know, I work full time
and I have two kids
so my spare time usually involves something with the kids.
Yeah.
You know, hobbies,
we, I, I can't really say that we have hobbies.
It's more like maybe projects or something on the weekend.
You know, we like to go out  go  out,
Yeah,
family.
Well, well, that's what I meant by salt that we, we did that like as a family, little ornaments and, things like that, and just kind of really got into it. Like during the Christmas season, making them up for other people and things like that.
Oh.
Uh-huh.
Right.
But as far as,
Uh-huh.
I've just never been very skilled at,  far, you  know, needle, work
Uh-huh.
And the things I've tried to do just don't look very good
and,
I, I guess mostly as far as, as crafts go, I've done, um, some needlepoint.
I've done mostly cross stitching.
I used to, uh, do like, um,
one that I did for both kids are like, oh,
they're plaques with, you know, different kind of animals
and then you have their birth date on them,
Yeah.
and then you have a little picture of them
and you frame them and stuff,
Uh-huh.
but nothing steady.
Just when I get some spare time here and there I'll work on it,
but, you know, it's nothing that I, can really,
It's not, like you sit and knit every night
No.
Not at all.
Yeah.
I don't even know how to knit
and my mother used to knit, you know,  all  the time
Uh-huh.
and, and I don't even know how to knit
I'm like, that's a lost art from this family
Yeah.
So, um,
but, it's not a very good topic
it feels like,  if,  you know,
No.
not when you're
neither one of us are really,
I, I have seen things I really like, you know, that were done, especially like needlepoint.
Uh-huh.
Needlepoint, cushions and things.
Yeah.
But, it just seems like there'd be so much time involved in it, you know, and, and that the petty point and things like that.
Yeah.
It's like, God, it, it seems like it's easier just to go out and buy it already  made
I don't know what, what, is,
it's like there,
but here a lot of the country stuff is in, you know, a lot of the woodwork, a lot of, uh, stenciling.
Yeah.
And, you know, you can go to any, like a flea market and stuff
and there's just tons of stuff everywhere
and,  you  know, people just do it in their garage
Yeah.
and then on weekends they go out and sell it
and during the week they go back and do some more.
And see, they do that as their job. Whereas,  you know,  for us it,
Right
and they make it cheaper for us to buy
Yeah
Definitely.
So,
but, and, I mean, I'm sure it must be relaxing to do things like that
because I can remember when I used to do, you know, those little salt, those figurines and things.
It was, it was relaxing, you know, creative,
you felt very creative.
Uh-huh.
But, it just was so time, time,  involved,  you know, so much time involved and the different steps and things.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
So,
and,
Okay
Well, I think, I think we're okay.
I think we did five minutes,
so we don't have to keep talking about nothing anymore
Yeah.
So,
Okay.
Well, thank you.
Okay.
I hope you have a good rest of your weekend.
Thanks.
Bye-bye.
Okay.
Bye-bye.

Okay,
Gene
So, it's nice to talk with you
and, um, food is a very intriguing thing.
Our lives are, are built around foods that we like and, nutritionally good for us.
Yes, sir.
What kind of dining out do you like?
Well, there is two kinds.
One I guess I'd say is with my wife where we enjoy, uh oh, I guess we usually enjoy a good seafood restaurant.
Oh.
Uh, you know, something nice.
Yeah.
And the other is with my whole family whom we, uh, go somewhere that the kids will enjoy
Uh, recently we have been hitting Pancho's up.
It's a local Mexican restaurant.
Uh-huh.
because they have got a good rate on, you know, good prices and everything.
Pancho's, that's,  a new  one.
Yeah.
Yeah,
Uh-huh.
it's, it's a chain down uh,
it goes up into Colorado and down here.
I don't know where else it is.
What about you?
We have  one called Chi Chi's in in our area.
Oh, yeah.
And, uh, we had a restaurant called La Bamba
but it's just, it closed recently.
But Chi Chi's is a national restaurant, I think.
Isn't it Mexican?
I think,  think it might be.
Do you  have it there?
I've I think I've seen it around.
Yes, sir.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Well,  I love Mexican food myself.
Oh, do you?
Yeah.
But you go ahead now
Oh, we, we do too.
We, uh, we enjoy Mexican food.
I'm just not impressed with the quality of it.
It's just primarily the price that's, uh, satisfying at this point.
But the kids,  seem to enjoy it.
Is that right?
Uh-huh.
Uh, and, uh, let's see.
We've, uh, just recently discovered a super restaurant down here
but it's, uh, not part of a chain
it's just an individually owned seafood restaurant.
But the first one we've been to that, uh, I don't think there was anything on the menu, that, that any of us had
that was, uh, not just really super.
It's nice to find a place like that.
Oh, boy that is wonderful.
Yeah.
Well, I, I agree with you on that.
And I was really a seafood addict myself.
I, I love crab meat in particular.
Um.
I, uh, I can almost live on, on seafood and almost live on the crab meat if I had to.
Oh, boy.
Have you ever been to, uh, what is it, Original Book Binders in Philadelphia?
I, uh, know the name
but I haven't been there.
Uh, that's an old established, uh, restaurant.
I used to go there when I was in college.
Uh-huh.
Where did you go to college?
Uh, I went to the Naval Academy.
Oh, the  U S ,  Naval Academy?
And we used to,  we use to go up there on, uh, for football games sometimes. And have some liberty.
Uh-huh.
And,
yeah,
we would go over there to, uh,
pretty sure it was original, Original Book Binders
I think it was,
yes.
I'll be darn.
I haven't been back there in years.
Well, we're, we're supposed to be talking about dinning out,
but I'll just make one comment that, uh, I just retired from Penn State,
and, uh, all my work has been in research for the Navy
Okay.
What area?
Underwater acoustics.
Is that right?
Did you have any dealings with the, uh, underwater sound reference laboratory in Orlando, Florida?
I have dealt with nearly all of the, all of the research laboratories that the country has.
Yes, sir.
My dad worked there for years, and years.
Uh-huh.
That's that's, uh, that's where I grew up was down in Orlando.
So,
Oh,  you grew up in Orlando.
Uh-huh.
That's, uh, that's interesting, Well, I was in submarines. Uh,
Well, that's what I worked on.
Okay,
yeah,
must have had some interesting, uh, assignments for you there.
when did you retire?
The end of last month.
Well, great.
I'm sure you've seen some interesting developments in acoustics.
I certainly have
Yeah.
So, I hate to, uh,
I wish I could talk to you about that, uh,
but, uh, I guess we should continue on, uh,
Okay.
Okay.
Right.
Where's,
How  do you like Chinese food?
Oh, we, we do enjoy that.
Yes, sir.
Uh, I don't know if we are particularly adventurous,
we find something we like, uh, like cashew shrimp or something that's got a good, uh, at a particular restaurant
and then we usually stick by it.
But do you,  What about you?
Uh-huh.
Well, I, uh, enjoy the Szechuan type of, uh, Chinese food.
Hot?
Yes.
Uh-huh.
Yep, uh,
it's, uh,
I, I do a lot of Chinese cooking myself.
I have in the past.
I haven't done recently,
but, uh, it's in the sweet and sour porks and things like are just really delicious meals.
Um. Where did you learn how to do Chinese cooking?
Uh, just at home.
Uh-huh.
I, I enjoyed the food
and I bought a lot of, uh, good cookbooks,
and I've been following through on that.
When you find the right cookbook, why it works out.
Uh-huh.
What's a good reference cookbook for Chinese food?
Okay,
well, that one's a good question.
Here it's right under my nose if I can find it
Oh, boy.
I guess one of the things we've, uh, started avoiding is the, uh, run of the mill chop suey and things like that.
Yeah,
right.
But we enjoy  trying, uh, different kinds of chicken or, uh, you know, even, uh, shrimp, uh, dishes that are fixed in a Chinese restaurant.
One of this book I have is called CHINESE COOKING MADE EASY.
Uh, it's a paperback
and I think it's by someone named Chang.
Yeah,
Isabelle Chang.
Okay,
thanks for that, uh, reference.
Yeah,
yeah.
I think you will enjoy that.
Okay,
good.
Yeah.
Well, it certainly is nice talking with you Gene.
And, uh, what is your phone at home?

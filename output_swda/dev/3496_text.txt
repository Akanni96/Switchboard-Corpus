Okay,
do we just go ahead?
Uh-huh.
Okay.
Do you want to start?
Uh, well, we're supposed to talk about vacations
Right.
and, uh, I'm trying to think of the ones that I've been on that I liked the most
and probably the one I liked most was Hawaii
Oh, did you get to go to Hawaii?
Yes.
Yeah,
we went there for our twenty-fifth wedding anniversary.
It's lovely, isn't it?
Yes.
We went, uh, six months after we were married.
Uh-huh.
And we just went to, uh, two islands.
What islands did you go to?
We went to Oahu and Kauai.
Kauai,
uh-huh.
We went to Kauai,
and then we also hit Maui,
and then, of course, uh
The big one.
uh, the big one,
uh-huh.
Oh.
With, uh, the big one I thought was very commercialized.
Oh, yeah.
It was.
But the other two were just lovely.
Yes,
I enjoyed Kauai better, too.
Uh-huh,
it was quiet and restful, and, and so beautiful.
It wasn't commercialized.
Oh, it was rainy
Yeah
was it?
Rainy,
but, you know, we don't like to spend the money to go over there and sit on the beach anyway
so,
That's right.
Well, it wasn't real rainy.
We had a few showers, but, uh, nothing that really got in the way with anything and just very brief ones
and, and, when, uh,
now we went to Nassau
and my husband liked it better than he did Hawaii.
Oh, really?
Uh-huh.
Oh.
Yeah,
he really did.
I don't know why.
You know, he didn't like Oahu at all
He thought
Uh-huh.
Oh.
Did you go there?
Uh-huh.
That was wonderful
Yeah.
and we both enjoyed it very much.
That was That was nice,
uh-huh.
You know, I've been to Nassau, too.
Have you?
I went on a cruise.
Oh, neat.
Uh-huh,
and, uh, to tell you the truth, I, I think I'd rather just go to the island.
Yeah,
uh, our son and daughter-in-law just, uh, they got married last January and they won a cruise.
And I know they didn't like it.
Now, we have several friends that, uh, have been on, and just love them.
But James and I like,
I don't know,
I think we would get bored on the boat all the time.
Well, I, got sick.
Oh, did you?
Yeah,
I did the first night.
I went with my sister just, uh, a couple years ago
Ooh.
Uh-huh.
and, and we both, the first night, just had to leave dinner.
Um.
It was bad,
but, and then after that it was, it got better,
but we just,
it was a four day
Uh-huh.
and we were both ready to get off the boat.
Were you?
Yeah.
Well, I think if we ever go, it will only be for a three day.
Now we've been real lucky.
We've been to Europe twice.
Oh, have you?
Yeah.
We went, the first time we went to London, Europe and touched a little bit of Scotland
And second time we went to Munich, Germany and were there a week, and loved Germany.
Oh.
It is just absolutely gorgeous with the mountains
Wow.
I'll bet it is.
and we were there in the fall before the snows, you know, started
and it was wonderful.
It, uh it was just, it was marvelous.
Oh.
And we would love to go back there
and we'd love to go back to London.
You haven't been to Spain?
No
Oh.
have not been to Spain.
I was born there.
Were you?
Yes
How old were you when you left?
Uh, just ten months.
Oh, ten months,
uh-huh.
Yeah,
so,
Have you ever got to go back?
No,
no,
and I would like to.
Would you?
My, uh, my sister,
we went with them to Germany
and, uh, she would like to go to Spain.
I'm not sure whether I would like to or not.
Huh.
And, uh, I would like to go to Ireland.
Would you?
Uh-huh.
Now, now I don't know if I'd like to go there just from the the problems.
Well, the
there is
uh-huh,
is, is a little scary,
but I would still like to see it.
I'd like to see, uh, Italy.
Oh, yeah,
yeah.
I would love to go there.
That would be nice.
And, course, there is a lot of places in the United States I still want to come, you know, go to.
Now, have you been to Yellowstone?
Uh,
Yellowstone,
Yes,
yes.
Have you?
We have been there.
We, I was there as a child and then we, we went to California and came back through Yellowstone with our kids.
Uh-huh.
And they loved it.
Well,
I was in Utah, in Salt Lake City when I was a, uh, youngster.
Oh, uh-huh.
So, uh, you know, I've touched on that.
Yeah,
now I'm just about, oh, a half hour, uh, north of Salt Lake.
Oh.
So, uh, it's at
Yeah.
my husband works in Salt Lake,
so
Uh-huh.
we're real close
and, yeah,
we,
Now that's a pretty city.
Yes,
we, we like it.
Very clean. You know.
Yeah.
It is.
Utah is a pretty state from what I remember of it.
Well, we kind of like it
Uh-huh
Well, do you like to camp, those kind of trips?
We,
no,
we used to
We used to camp a lot with our
Uh-huh.
Oh, you like the motels?
We like the motels,
yes
Oh, oh, well.
We have, we've gone past the camping stage.
We lived in Chattanooga, Tennessee for two years.
Oh, did you?
And we did a lot of camping out there in the Smokeys
and it was beautiful
and our kids loved it and everything
and then we moved to, uh, uh, the Dallas area
Uh-huh.
and, uh, it's hot down here
and camping is not near as much fun.
Oh.
And, uh, so, and then the kids were getting older and, and were involved in activities so the camping sort of went by the wayside. And, uh, although our son loves to fish
Huh.
and, uh, and our daughter and her husband are talking now about starting camping with their boys now that they have gotten older.
Uh-huh.

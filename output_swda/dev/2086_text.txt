Okay,
in order to make the, uh, curried chicken, I just fried the chicken, until it was nice and brown, you know
Uh-huh.
make sure it's nice and brown on both sides
and then you take it out of the fat
and you, you let the chicken you fried kind of drain, so that a lot of the oil comes out of it
Uh-huh.
And then you, you, uh, pour most of the, all of the oil out of the pan
and you kind of clean it out
and you put back maybe two tablespoons full of the oil and saute some, um, bell peppers and onions in, in that little bit of oil.
Maybe one tablespoon or two tablespoons, let that brown, then put all of the chicken back in there.
And then you, uh, mix flour and a cup of water, maybe, uh, one tablespoon of flour and a cup of water.
Stir it real, real well.
Uh-huh.
Then you, uh, pour that in there, you know, to make the gravy.
And you let it come to a boil again
and then you let it simmer
and you add, uh, about a tablespoon of, what I'm using now is Jamaican curry powder.
Oh.
And that's going to, it's going to be really good
That's very spicy, too.
Yeah,
it's,
I mean these bell peppers and curry.
Right,
and then if you like it really hot, you can add some hot, hot peppers and hot sauce and all that kind of stuff.
Oh, that sounds really good.
Yeah.
Huh.
I guess it was,
is this dinner time for you?
Uh, well it will be in a little while,
I'm trying to get it, get it ready early.
All done in advance,
yeah.
That's um, I, uh, I'm, I'm not that great a cook
but I was single until I was thirty
so I did cook a little, you know.
Oh.
Uh, and I cook a little bit now.
What I like to do mostly is stir fries
and my wife normally says, oh, Tom, why, why don't you make a stir fry tonight
and so we even, we just were recently married so we have a stir fry pan sort of like a big wok.
Uh-huh.
And we do a lot of, um, stir fry vegetables.
What kind of wok do you have,
is it, is it a real Chinese wok.
It's, it's called a stir fry pan
and it, and it fits right on your, uh, it fits right on your burner, whether it's gas or electric
so it's, it has a flatter bottom than a normal wok does.
Uh-huh.
I see.
And, um, normally what what we do is, um, just, you know, like two tablespoons of oil, maybe sesame oil or some other type of oil than just regular vegetable oil.
But I will use peanut, peanut oil, or things.
And then we just stir fry broccoli and carrots and, um, green peppers, and, um, maybe put in a little bit of, um garlic and ginger, uh, beforehand.
That gives, uh, uh, uh, spicier flavor
and then after the stir fry is over, just mix in, um, a little bit of, uh, sometimes chicken broth, and corn starch and soy sauce
Yeah.
and that sort of makes a, uh, a glaze, that sticks to the, the vegetables,
Uh-huh.
I've used,
you turn them over.
A lot of times when we do stir fry we just put in tofu,
we don't put in meat, cause I guess we're, I'm not
Uh-huh.
but, uh, she likes to watch all the, how much red meat and things,
so. We'll do, a lot of times vegetarian.
Yeah.
But it's a real good meal because you have squash and broccoli and, uh, carrots and celery and green peppers and, um, oh, gee, mushrooms.
Oh that's, That sounds real good except the squash,
It's, it's a pretty big
and we put that over rice.
I just don't like squash.
Oh, you don't
I never did.
My mother used to cook a whole pan full of squash
and she'd have squash and corn bread
Oh.
And maybe some, she'd have chicken or something.
Uh-huh.
And I'd just be,
Yeah,
see, we never, in fact I never had squash growing up.
My, my wife eats more vegetables, ate more vegetable than I did growing up.
I'm, I'm from Pittsburgh
and Pittsburgh is a very meat and potato town.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
recipes in Pittsburgh consisted of red meat and a potato.
Uh-huh.
Red meat and a potato.
Oh, that sounds good.
We, we were from North Carolina
and we had a garden
and my mother would, would, uh, grow the squash
and she'd grow white potatoes and onions and cabbage and collards and all kinds of,
Oh, she had all of those types of vegetables.
Right.
See, never, no vegetables in my family.
Wow.
Yeah,
it was really funny.
You wouldn't believe it, we even raised chickens
Well that was a real farm.
You ever seen anybody kill a chicken?
No,
but I, I've, I've heard stories uh,
I've heard stories.
And they put the head under a tin tub and chop the head off.
Uh.
And then you hear the chicken jumping around under the tub
and finally it dies down,
you get just a little patter
and then it,
Oh, this is
you shouldn't be talking about this right before, while you're fixing dinner.
Getting ready to eat chicken too.
That's right,
you should be careful
That's pretty funny.
But my dad used to tell stories, you know, about the way they eat chickens
but I never, we never, we lived in the suburbs,
we, we bought everything in a grocery store.
Uh-huh.
There was no,
but it was funny, you know,
it so,
but when we got married, you know, a lot more vegetables, a lot more, you know, a lot of changes.
Well that's good.
A lot of people are eating healthier now a days.
I think so too,
Yeah.
but we just went shopping
and we came back with, uh, with, uh, sweets, you know, chocolate covered peanuts
and uh, we came back with sweets.
Ugh.
We didn't bring all the healthy food back too.
Yeah,
I'm trying to learn how to cook, um, deserts without, without all of the sweets, you know, maybe use honey or something.
Uh-huh,
well that's, that's supposed to be, um, the trend of the future, but, uh, the cut back.
Yeah.
I, uh, recently was over a friends house that's Indian
and, uh, she had brought Indian sweets into the office
and it was really funny because they were made from yogurt and carrots.
Ugh.
Yeah,
that was a sweet
and I was like ugh.
This is a sweet.
Oh it is, it's a candy,
I'm like ugh, you know,
Indian candy is not very good.
Uh, right.
But everything was, and everything,
you didn't notice it at first,
but everything was sort of hot.
Everything had a little bit of curry in it.
The spice,
yeah.
It was funny, even the sweets did.
Wow.
When you first took a bite of them you didn't notice it
but then after a couple of minutes you could taste it.
You know, it had that, that after taste that, very, it was a very Indian flavor.
Yeah.
Good,
they didn't have,
I didn't like her desserts very well,
they were very, yogurt and carrots and pistachios, pistachio nuts and yogurt.
Uh-huh.
And it wasn't very good.
Well I might have liked some of that
I, I like hot stuff,
Uh-huh.
I really do.
Yeah,
well have we done our ten minutes.
Oh is it ten minutes.
Something like that,
I think we're,
I don't know,
do we get a signal.
No,
normally they just come in
and they say you've overextended your, your conversation.
Oh, well this is my first one.
Oh, okay
well that's,
you'll see it will normally, it will come on
and it'll say you've over extended your conversation, you now have fifteen minutes to fifteen seconds to complete it.
Oh wow.
But, uh, I've been cut off twice.
Uh-huh.
So I just thought,
in fact I'm just also,
I'm hearing a siren outside I think my, my neighbors car must have got bumped, you know,
he has one of those alarms on his car,
Goodness.
one of the, the neighbor has an alarm on a car
and it's going off.
Uh-huh.
So, I was going to go out and see what they were doing.
Well, okay.
Okay,
hey thanks so much.
Yeah,
thank you,
it was nice talking with you.
Uh-huh,
and you said this was your
well you'll, you'll get a couple more probably.
Yeah.
I, uh, I called yesterday, I, or Friday,
maybe I talked to somebody that, uh, I got them on, uh, during the day.
It was a housewife
and she was home with two kids.
Ugh.
And while we're talking the kids are screaming in the background, you know, that they wanted something
and they were arguing back and forth
and she just kept talking the whole time,
it was pretty funny.
Yeah,
kind of hard that way.
Okay.
Okay.
Hey thanks a lot,
I'll talk to you later.
All right,
thank you,
bye-bye.
Bye.

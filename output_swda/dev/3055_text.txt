And I guess, the suggestion is that we maybe talk about a menu for a dinner party, if we wanted to do something like that or, share recipes or something, um.
Yes,
uh-huh.
sure.
Right,
Are you one who gives dinner parties very often?
No.
No,
nor am I.
I avoid them with all
They are a lot of work,
that is for sure.
Yeah,
they are,
I mean I do them,
Yes.
but they are a lot of work.
Yeah.
I usually have them when I, there is a special event in our lives
and I, I make a big deal out of it for them.
Yeah.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
And, uh, I think I am most, uh, happiest with my most, familiar foods that I know are successful.
Yeah.
Right,
yes.
You know, and I have, I make my own pies and pie crust
and, you know, I can make my pies from scratch,
Uh-huh.
I do not need a recipe to follow.
And, uh,
Oh, that's great.
You sound like my mother who has been,
well I bake pies too,
but my mother was always the famous pie baker in the family
and she has the same, the same technique,
I mean, I guess after many years of doing it, you just,  kind of do it second nature.
Yeah,
you just know from heart.
I had one of the ladies at church that tasted my coconut cream pie
and she said make me one,
and I made her one.
Uh.
And when I, when she gave me back the plate, she said "I did not share this with anybody".
And I thought whoa, that was a big pie.
She enjoyed it, huh
Yes
Well, there is a woman in our choir, who is nearly famous for her apple pies,
Uh-huh.
and, uh, we had a, a, an auction one time at the church
excuse me, and, uh, one of her pies was auctioned for fifty dollars
My word,
she must have a great pie recipe then.
Well, I think I, I have had it once
and it has been a few years ago,
but I do recall that it was quite good,
so, uh,
Wonderful.
Yeah.
So, that is her specialty, uh,
I like to bake, uh, also,
I do not bake so much now that my children are grown,
but I do enjoy baking
and I guess I always liked making, uh, cookies and bars and things like that,
that was more my specialty, I suppose.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
And they seem to last longer than pies around here
pies would go practically, in a day's time
Yeah
you,
That's right,
yeah
they are meant for the, that evening's, dessert
Yes.
and, you know, it has got to be gone or daddy gets into the, you know, the leftovers.
Right
Puts about two more inches on his waistline
and then  he is chastising,  himself afterward
And ,
Well, it is interesting that,
yesterday, I had lunch with a friend
and she was telling me that she had a dinner party over the weekend, for friends of hers.
Uh-huh.
For, um, uh,
one of her acquaintances, one of her old friends, I guess, had been in town
and, uh, they invited two other couples over
and so there were seven of them that, uh,
I said "well, what did you have"
and she said what she had, uh, just Mexican food,
but, you know, she had, uh, uh, guacamole
and, uh, I cannot remember all she had.
But she also had made, uh, flan, which is actually Spanish, I think.
Have you ever made that or had it?
No,
I have not,
huh-uh.
It's, uh, it's, um,
I had, used to work with a gentleman who was from Cuba, who would make it, uh,
Uh-huh.
it's just a wonderful dessert.
It's like, uh, an egg custard in a caramelized sugar, with on top of it.
Oh, okay.
And it's, it's quite, actually, not very difficult to make,
but it's very, very high in cholesterol, I am sure with all the eggs that are in it.
Sure,
yeah.
But, uh, she said that she and her husband had, uh, traveled in Spain a couple years ago.
And, and flan is almost, uh, a basic with every meal that you get, there.
Like apple pie in America,
right.
Yeah,
uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Wow,
uh-huh.
It's just very customary to get flan.
So if you ever run into that you will sort, of be aware of what that is all about.
Yeah.
But, uh, I would never have thought of making that as part of a, a Mexican dinner,
but, you know, sopapillas, I guess, would be another kind of a dessert, if you decided to do something like that.
But
Uh-huh.
flan is something you can, make ahead and have just, you know, have ready
Uh-huh.
but, uh. Well, I would, have been thinking I would like to have a dinner party sometime soon,
but I tell you it,
I
my
it's one of those things where it does require some real, uh, planning
and, it's, you know,
Yes,
uh-huh.
you don't just make the dinner,
you have the house to clean and, you know, the whole business that goes with it.
Well, when I have a dinner party that is my motivation for getting the, house clean
Yeah.
Probably a good way to do it.
Oh, the house needs cleaning, I guess I had better have a dinner party
Yeah,
yeah,
we are catering a wedding, uh, um, in August
and, uh, this lady that is,
Oh.
it at,
it's at her house,
she is not a good housekeeper.
Uh-huh.
So she has got to hire this crew, of four women to come in two weeks prior to the wedding and get it ready.
Oh.
Good heavens
Yes,
and there, you know,
she is, she must have found some jewels, because they start in the corner and work out.
Uh.
Oh, wow.
Yeah,
so,
That is such a nice thing,
it's,
Uh-huh.
I, you know,
until,
well we have,
my husband and I have been married twenty six years,
and until last year I had never had another person clean my house,
and, then I got so involved and so busy, I said "this is one luxury I am going to let myself have every now and then".
Uh-huh.
And so, I had a woman come in, uh, once a month,
and you know, it was not just very often,
but for me it was wonderful
Sure,
yeah
that is nice, you know, to have that,
that's a, luxury, today.
Well,
it is,
and it is buys you time to do other things, like have a dinner party,  I guess.
That's  right,
yeah,
yeah.
So, it is just a real gift of time as far as I am concerned,
Uh-huh.
but, well, uh, I,
I, I have a pie crust recipe that I, that is unique, that has vinegar and egg in it,
Uh-huh.
I have heard about that.
Have you?
but I have never tried it.
No,
well I should say I have heard of one that has vinegar in it,
I do not know that it has egg in it.
Egg and sugar.
uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Do you have it right on the top of you head?
Uh, I,
no,
I think it would be too hazy, because, um, the,
I, uh,
no.
You do not have it,
yeah.
I would ,
Well, it,
like the liquid is like, a half cup of water and then your egg and then your tablespoon of vinegar,
Uh-huh.
Right.
and you mix that together
and then you, you know, your,
see it makes, it makes, uh, five pie crusts at once.
Uh, quite large,
yeah.
So, that,
it's quite a volume of,
Right.
I think it's four cups of floor,
Uh-huh.
and, like, uh, a tablespoon of salt and a tablespoon of sugar
and, and you combine your dry ingredients
Uh-huh.
and then you, uh, put in your liquid.
Yeah.
Uh, what is it about the, uh, the vinegar that, uh, makes, the crust better.
It just, it just makes it very pliable and, and very flaky,
Uh.
Interesting.
and, you can really treat it rough
and you are still going to have a flaky pie crust.
Yeah,
yeah,
boy, that, that's the real secret.
Like, uh, it's not mine,
it was from the, one of the magazines, probably, twenty years ago
and it said you can throw this on the floor and step on it
and, it will still be flaky.
I thought, wow, quite a statement for them to make.
Oh,
it makes me think of years ago, uh, when I was visiting my mother-in-law in, uh, Michigan,
she lived very near an apple orchard
and we just had,
we could take as many apples as we wanted from it.
you know, according to the owners,
and so I decided to bake about four pies ahead, you know, and freeze them,
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
well, talk about working with big amounts of pie crust, and having it be tough.
Those were the toughest apple crust, or apple, uh, pie crust, I have ever, ever made.
Oh, wow.
Wow.
It was terrible.
I, I could have used that recipe,
it sounds like.
Well, I am from Michigan.
Where about?
Detroit,
uh-huh.
Well, we lived in Plymouth for four years, uh,
Oh yeah,
that's real close.
Yeah.
In fact, I, we were there from, uh, seventy three to seventy seven
and, I was, I worked for the little, the weekly newspaper there, the, the Plymouth, oh what was it called, CRIER.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, my husband is from the upper peninsula,
so he was born and, raised up there.
Uh-huh.
That is where my mother-in-law still lives,
so, uh. Are you originally from Michigan
or,
Oh, yes.
Uh-huh.
Born in Detroit.
I will be darn.

Okay.
All right.
Go ahead.
Well, what kind of car would I want to buy.
Yeah.
I don't know.
The question is, I mean, would I want to buy,
or would I, would I probably actually buy.
May be two different things.
Oh, well, if you, if you had all your, all the money in the world or something.
If I had all the money I wanted, then that's whole different matter.
No,
in that case, I'd, I'd, I don't know.
I, I, my dream car for years was a, was a Porsche Turbo .
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
But, uh, I don't know if I'd want one of those now.
Oh, really?
Of course I would want one if somebody was was given to me.
Yeah.
But I maybe would buy a B M W. Uh, or, or even a Volvo.
Uh-huh.
What do you have now?
I've got a, uh, a Dodge Daytona.
Uh-huh.
It's actually the first car we ever bought new.
Oh, really.
Yeah,
we just, we, well, I have
my car is the first one we ever bought new, too.
Uh-huh.
But we just bought another used car, a couple weeks ago, actually.
Uh-huh,
yeah
me too
So what car do you drive?
What is it?
Uh, mine is a Honda Accord.
Uh-huh,
we almost bought one of those.
Do you like it?
Yeah,
I do,
and, and, um, it's funny because, after I bought it, I was doing a lot of business traveling,
and I,
some of the cars that I got were like the Toyota Camry and the Nissan Maxima and some of the competitors
Uh-huh.
and, um, I don't like them as well except, it wasn't really a fair comparison because those were automatics,
and mine is a standard
Yeah.
and the reason I got a standard was because I thought it handled a lot better
Uh-huh.
it had a lot more pickup and everything.
Yeah,
you get a little more control over when when it's doing the things it's doing.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Uh, what, what rental agent did you go to to actually rent to rent those kind of cars.
Um
usually AVIS.
To what, AVIS?
AVIS.
Really.
Yeah.
Huh.
I guess,
It's just because we're on,
I think of it,
I'm not sure those are AVIS or not,
but we have corporate contracts you know, with the various companies
I see.
Uh-huh.
so it depends on your destination, too.
Right.
Kind of strange
You work for a big company, then.
Work for T I. Uh-huh, which is how I heard about this
T I, I see.
Uh-huh. Um,
but yeah,
I, I, uh, I don't know,
I would probably, if I were to buy a car you know, with the constraints of real money I probably would, would go with something like, you know, like a Honda Accord.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Maybe it would,
one thing I, I really liked about, about the Dodge Daytona is the fact that they have, uh, this seven year warranty.
Oh, really.
Um, and it really saved us some big money once.
It did, huh.
Yeah,
they had a whole bunch of things that, that sort of broke at the same time
Oh, my gosh.
and the bill would have been over fifteen hundred dollars,
and I had to pay twenty five for the,
Oh, that was great.
Yeah,
it was.
That's unusual to hear,
usually, you know something breaks,
you look at the warranty
and it's excluded.
Well, we, we bought the extended, the the extension and, uh, at the time we bought it it was like, you know, I don't know, four hundred and twenty-five dollars or something extra.
Oh, I see,
okay.
Oh, you got your money's worth.
Yeah,
we did,
but, you know, we really debated at the beginning,
and of course I'm glad I did it.
Yeah.
Yeah,
that is good.
But, um, we still have, we still have like, you know, three years left on it.
Yeah,
well, I've been lucky.
Mine hasn't had any trouble except last week a shopping cart crashed into it
Oh, no.
but I was real lucky because it just hit the, um the lens to the light.
Bumper?
Oh.
It didn't actually dent the car or anything.
So it cost me twenty-five bucks to replace that,
Well, that was good.
and the store will pay for it anyway,
Are you.
so. No big deal.
Uh-huh.
Um, if you were, if you were going to, uh, buy a new car would you buy another, uh, another Accord?
Um, I probably wouldn't, just because I already have one
Uh-huh.
but, you know, if I had to make the choice again, I, yeah, I, I'm perfectly happy with what I decided um, although we did just buy another car,
Uh-huh.
and that's a Legend
Oh, yeah,
those are nice .
um, but it's, it's a used one
Uh-huh.
and, um, my husband has really wanted one for a long time,
and the fact that, you know, this this car that I have has performed so well,
and before that I also had an Accord,
it was a real old one
Uh-huh.
and, uh, I bought that used.
I had absolutely no money to my name and bought that,
and it served me real well, too.
Uh-huh.
So he's been impressed with all the Honda cars.
Right.
And.
Yeah,
my sister drives one.
She drives a, uh, I don't know, is it Legend
Uh-huh.
it's a,
I'm not certain,
but she's liked it. Um,
Yeah.
But, I, I have, I have never had,
and we,
in fact, what I'm driving right now,
we bought a, we only had one car for a long time,
and and yet most of our usage of the car was just this little shuttle back and forth, four miles to work and back kind of thing.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
And so, uh, I bought a used Yugo just to be a little, you know, little car that I could care less about
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
How did it go for you?
Oh, well, it's, uh, it's worked.
Hasn't left you stranded.
I mean, that's exactly what it is, you know,
it's just a, it's a cheap little little car just to go, you know, run around town in
Yeah
I know.
Yeah.
and, uh. It's actually kind of fun to drive.
I, I,
you know, getting back in the Daytona now, I almost don't like it. You know
Really.
it's like too, too mushy,
and it, you know it's an automatic,
Huh.
and
Well, that's what my husband thinks about my car now, that he's had the Legend
it's too,
the steering
it's windy.
you know, you feel like you're in a boat or something, you know,
it's kind of,
I can't drive that,
the Legend, it's just so huge.
Oh.
I, I don't like it,
and it's so, uh,

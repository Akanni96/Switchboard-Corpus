Do you want to start?
Yeah,
I'm trying to think what I've seen lately.
I
well we just finished watching, uh, TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES on tape, you know
Did you watch DANCES WITH WOLVES,
did you see the movie?
Yeah,
we, we've seen that,
yeah.
Did you like it?
Yeah,
it was great,
have you seen it?
I thought it was very well done.
Yeah,
I, um,
How about GHOST?
We, we saw, an, we liked it
but, you know, I didn't think it was as good as all the, uh, hype was about it.
Right,
I feel the same way about that too.
It was okay.
Yeah,
I
I, I couldn't see it worth getting a nomination for, uh, best picture.
No,
no.
And, uh,
let's see, uh,
the most recent ones that I've seen are those two, GHOST and, uh, DANCES WITH WOLVES,
but I rent, uh, uh, videos,
do you?
Yeah,
yeah,
and so we just,
You, you watch many?
Uh, it depends, um, you know, it depends on
Do you like the classics like, uh, GONE WITH THE WIND and, uh, you know the older movies.
I'd like to see those,
I keep, you know, um, you know, there's like three movies that I, I keep telling myself that I should see one of these, you know, some day that I haven't seen, you know, that, that are classics, you know.
Because I've never seen CITIZEN KANE,
Yeah,
that was good.
and never seen, I've  never seen CASABLANCA and never seen GONE WITH THE WIND.
I think I've seen most of Humphrey Bogart's movies, but, in, in, you know a long time ago,
Uh-huh.
and,  uh, like the MALTESE FALCON and all those, uh, uh,
Oh, I, I
we saw part of THE AFRICAN QUEEN on, on T V a couple of years ago,
Yeah,
that was good,
yeah.
and I've, I've I've  been wanting to see all of it
but we just, you know, we walk into the video store
and we're like well why don't we go see this now
so.
Yeah,
yeah,
it's true.
But, um, I
one of the movies we saw recently, we saw, uh, MISERY.
Oh, I didn't see that one.
That was good, um,
Really.
oh,  it was great.
And it,
you think, you know, for a Stephen, you know, it because it was by Stephen King it would be really gory
but there's only one,
well there's a couple scenes, at, at the end there's, there is, you know some blood and everything
and there's one really bad scene where it's, I mean, there's not blood but it's pretty graphic
Yeah.
But it's, um, it's a really good movie, um.
Really,
is that the one where, uh, the guy gets captured by that women?
Yeah,
yeah,
Okay,
yeah.
he's a writer
and, um, she's his biggest fan
and she's also  a little,  a little on the nutso side.
Yeah,
right.
Uh-huh.
Did you see PACIFIC HEIGHTS?
No,
we haven't, um,
I saw that one,
that one wasn't that great either.
Oh, it wasn't?
Well I didn't think so,
no.
I, I got,
I heard like mixed reviews, um, of that,
we
How about SILENCE OF THE LAMBS?
That's, that's on our list of things to see
I know,
I, I wanted to see,
I, I was curious if you had seen it
and that, uh,
our big thing is, um,
you know, movie prices up here
I think it's like six bucks now in the theaters,
Yeah.
you know. So it's like,
you know, a lot of things we try to catch like at the dollar theater or matinees
and then a lot of other stuff we just wait until it comes out on tape.
That's us too,
yeah,
yeah
true.
I know, it's too bad that they've gotten so expensive.
well one movie we saw in the last couple of months that we really enjoyed was, uh, EDWARD SCISSORHANDS.
Oh, really.
Yeah,
have you seen that?
No.
Oh, it was great
Really.
Yeah
it was,
I thought it was kind of maybe for kids more, than
No,
no,
it's, um, it's an odd film
and it's really interesting that,
I like the director a lot, um, a guy named Tim Burton.
Uh-huh.
Did you ever see the movie BEETLEJUICE?
Uh, part of it,
I,  I never  really watched the whole thing.
Oh,
Oh,
yeah,
well if you, if you liked BEETLEJUICE you'll probably like EDWARD SCISSORHANDS,
if you didn't like BEETLEJUICE you'll probably won't like EDWARD SCISSORHANDS.
Oh, really.
Yeah,
it's, um,
Burton's kind of, uh,
he's, a very odd, odd man
but he's,
I think he's very interesting
and, uh, I liked those two movies of his a lot.
Uh-huh.
He  did BATMAN also, which, you know
Yeah,
that was pretty good, though, really.
It was good,
but I mean, he was, um,
When you think of what it takes to make some of those kind of movies, you know.
Yeah.
You see it for, uh, you know a couple of hours or an hour
and it really,
there's a lot in it when you look at the scenery and the cars,  and all the  different stuff like that, you know.
Oh, yeah, oh.
Yeah.
Whose your favorite actress or actor?
Um, don't really know,
I like Costner a lot
but, uh,  I'm  a big, I'm a big baseball fan
Uh-huh.
so, you know, after BULL DURHAM and FIELD OF DREAMS, you know,
Yeah.
Um, although, you know,
That was good,
I saw that movie too.
That was very good.
Which one?
FIELD OF DREAMS.
Yeah,
FIELD OF DREAMS was good,
um, and, I, I think, I liked the other movies he's done.
NO WAY OUT was really good
and,
Oh, yeah,
yeah.
did you ever  see SILVERADO?
SILVERADO,
uh, who, who was that with?
Um, let's see.
Danny Glover, Scott Glen, Kevin Kline, um, Brian Dennehy , Jeff Goldblum's in.
Uh, John Kreas is in it if you don't blink.
That,
the
the, the title sounds familiar,
I'm trying to
It was, it was a big western,
I mean, I think Roseanne Arquett was in it too, another one that if you blink you'd miss her.
Uh, it was,
and I think it was like a three hour movie or two and a half hours,
and, and it was one of those ones that could have been four hours if they hadn't cut a lot out.
Oh, really.
Um, but  it was, it was really good Um,
I, I might have seen part of that because the name sounds familiar although I I would remember, I think in, with him in it.
Uh-huh.
How  about REVENGE,
did you see that with him?
No,
I didn't,
is that any good?
With, uh, Anthony Quinn.
I thought it was,
I like everything he's done so far.
Oh, okay.
You know, it's, uh, one of those movies that it's not a great movie
but it was okay.
Yeah,
we were in the video store today
and somebody was recommending it to somebody.
You know the, the people who run the video store was recommending it to somebody else.
Yeah
it was, it was not a bad movie.
Huh, well, I'll have to catch it one of these days.
You
you, you said you seen NO WAY OUT?
Yeah,
that was excellent.
Yeah,
that was very good.
Um, he was in THE UNTOUCHABLES, too.
Now that's another one I wanted to see.
in fact, that was advertised not too long ago.
Yeah,
it was on, um,
Cable?
no,
it was on one of the networks, I think last weekend.  Uh, or two weeks  ago.
Okay,
I know I saw,  yeah, something about it.
Yeah,
I, um, I wish, I, I mean I'd seen it when, when, you know, it was originally in the theaters
and, um, I saw it, you know, I saw part of it again.
Uh-huh.
I  mean I like, you know, I like Costner,
I like Sean Connery,
and, uh, there's this one, there's this one actor,
it's really silly that I enjoy him a lot
but I, I've really enjoyed him in everything I've seen him in, a guy named Charles Martin Smith.
I don't know him.
Um, you've probably seen him
and just, an,
you know, oh, that's who the guy is.
Do you remember,
did you ever see AMERICAN GRAFFITI?
No,
I, I don't think so.
Oh.
Did you ever see the movie STAR MAN.
Yes.
Okay,
in STAR MAN, he was the guy chasing after, um, Jeff Bridges and Karen Allen, or Nancy Allen.
Okay,
okay.
You know,
short nerdy guy with glasses.
Yeah,
yeah.
He's, he's just,
I, I don't know why but he's always a lot of fun in every movie he's in.
He was in the UNTOUCHABLES.
He was the accountant
Oh, oh I know who you mean.
Yeah.
He  was in, uh, uh, HONEY DON'T SHRINK THE KIDS, wasn't he?
No,
no,
you're thinking of Rick Moranis.
He looks like Rick Moranis
but he's not
Oh, okay,
all right,
yeah,
that's the one I was thinking of.
But I have, I've seen quite a few movies,
I, I enjoy them.
I think that, uh, it's, it's kind of like, uh, good entertainment. An, uh, an escape type of thing.
Yeah.
Yeah.
How about some of the ads,
do you go by the ads when you look at them, or the reviews?
Do they influence you a lot.
Uh, a little of,
a review usually won't make me go see a movie I hadn't already wanted to see.
Yeah.
Did you see GOODFELLAS?
No,
it's uh,
I want to see it.
That that was pretty good.
Um, and,
Um, we want to see GODFATHER PART THREE also
but my, my girlfriend's seen part one and part two although she saw them years ago,
Uh-huh.
but  I've never seen either of the first, you know, of the, of the GODFATHER movies
so, we're probably going to like rent those some time and then try to see GODFATHER PART THREE somewhere.
I was just going to say, you should see those, uh, first if you can.
Yeah.
If if you read the book it's, uh, even better.
The book was excellent.
Oh, okay,
I haven't,  never  read it.
Yeah.
and, uh, I was a little disappointed in the third
it's GODFATHER THREE.
It was not bad
but, I expected more, I think.
Uh-huh.
We just rented, um, a couple weeks ago, a movie called THE FRESHMAN,
with, um,
it's got Matthew Broderick in it and, um, uh, Marlon Brando.
And Brando like does a parody of the character he played in THE GODFATHER.
Oh, really.
Um, yeah,
it's, it's one of the reasons why, you know THE GODFATHER's been on our minds lately.
Um, but, uh,  there's  a bunch of scenes from, uh, uh, from THE GODFATHER that's used because Matthew Broderick's going to film school.
And, uh, in his classes they're using, there's a they're running a bunch of scenes from THE GODFATHER
and then he's running into Marlon Brando who is playing, you know, this you know this, uh, organized crime head.
Uh-huh.
So, it's um, it was, it was a fun movie.
Uh.
or, uh,
I liked RAINMAN,
I thought, I thought it was interesting that he was doing
Oh, yeah,
that was good,
I liked RAINMAN, too.
Yeah,
well I'm,
being from Baltimore, of course, I'm a big Barry Levinson fan since, uh, he, he's, you know, he's done a bunch of Baltimore movies.
Uh-huh.
Um,
Barry Levinson did, um, DINER and TINMAN, and AVALON which are all set in Baltimore.
Yeah,
they sound familiar.
I probably saw parts of those.
You know, a lot of times I'll I'll start watching a movie
and I'm tired
and it,
Uh-huh.
next  thing you know, it's, it's
especially if there's commercial in it
and then  the titles might sound familiar
but I really don't know what they're all about.
of the three of those, DINER's probably the best.
I mean, they're, they're all pretty good,
but DINER is really worth seeing.
Is that the one set in the fifties, or sixties.
Uh, late fifties,
yeah.
Late fifties,
yeah,
I think I saw that one.
Okay
and, uh,
How about Meryl Streep,

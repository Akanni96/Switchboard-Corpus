Well, what movies have you seen recently, Valerie?
Let's see,
the last one we saw was THELMA AND LOUISE.
Oh, we haven't seen that one yet.
Well, don't bother
Oh, it wasn't that good.
Well, oh, from a woman's point of view and it was very, uh, chauvinistic as far as women go.
Uh, it was, it was entertaining,
but, yeah,
I don't think the general audience would, would go for it.
The most recent one that, uh, my wife and I have seen was the CITY SLICKER.
How was that?
That was excellent.
It was just a really, a really funny movie.
That is one I've been dying to see.
At the same time, it had a story line about people trying to find themselves.
There were parts that were sad.
I mean, it just ran the gamut of emotion.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh,
and,
And, but it was just all around entertaining.
How long did that movie run?
Uh, it's still on, to the best of my knowledge.
But, I mean, time wise, how long,
was it two hour
Oh.
or,
Uh, it's, I think it's less than two hours.
Uh-huh.
Okay,
okay.
We, we rented one recently that seemed to go on forever
That always seems to happen when you rent them, you know
Yeah,
but this one, it was fairly long.
I, I'm guessing probably an hour and forty-five minutes, maybe.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh,
and, uh, it,
But excellent acting by Billy Crystal and Bruno Kirby,
Was it, oh, good.
Uh-huh.
uh, who was the,
oh, Jack Palance had an excellent part in there as the old cowboy.
Oh, great.
So we really enjoyed that.
Oh, well, I'm looking forward to seeing that one.
That was next on our list,
so, uh,
Yeah,
I think that, uh, I can highly recommend that movie this, to see.
Okay,
okay,
good deal
Yeah.
good deal.
Do you rent movies very often,
or,
Uh, we generally rent a couple a week.
Uh, in order to get a decent movie to have on a weekend, you've got to rent it on Thursday.
Right.
Right.
They get they get taken up at the store,
That's exactly right.
so,
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
We will rent two or three movies on Thursday
and, uh, with luck, you'll have one or two that are good.
Yeah,
right,
right.
Most of them are a coin flip
Oh, gosh.
Yeah,
yeah.
And we usually have, oh, we don't get out as much as we like.
We have two children,
so we occasionally get out to the movies
Yeah.
but, uh, it's, it's fun, it's a fun thing to do to get out and be entertained for once.
Yeah, well,
Quite frequently, we have our grandchildren on the weekends
Uh-huh.
and, uh, we'll try to rent something that they can see as well as something else that we can see
and, Uh, Uh, generally try to stay in the at least P G range.
Uh-huh.
What ages are they?
Have you found trouble finding movies for them
or,
Right.
The, uh, the oldest is nine,
the youngest is three.
He doesn't really pay attention.
Yeah,
yeah.
The five year old doesn't have the attention span, either.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
But the, the nine year old will watch anything that's on T V
Uh-oh, uh-oh, yeah.
So,
They have been doing that.
We've been waiting for a, a good movie out this summer for the kids to see.
The last one they saw was HOME ALONE
and, uh, they enjoyed that,
but, uh, I missed that one.
My husband took the kids to see that one
so,
Yeah,
my wife took, uh, I think the kids to see that one,
but we can generally find something at the store for them to watch.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
yeah,
well, that's a good deal.
The,
uh, oh, we saw this movie,
PRESUMED INNOCENT was the one we rented, uh last weekend.
Okay,
let me think if I have rented that one.
Harrison Ford.
Harrison Ford and, how does the story line go?
It's, uh, he is a prosecuting attorney
and, uh, another prosecutor in the, a woman prosecutor in there is murdered
Oh, okay,
we haven't seen that one.
and he's trying to find it,
but, course, it's one of these with a twist where it looks like he's the one that wound up killing her
so it's, And it's an extremely long movie.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
It's, it's over two hours long.
Oh, gosh,
oh, gosh.
Which,
uh, my wife she likes the suspense movies.
I enjoy them to a degree.
Uh-huh.
I think that's the one I wanted to pick up the other day,
and then my husband wasn't going to be able to watch it with me,
so I thought I better save that one for another day
Save that for another day.
Yeah,
because I think he'd like that one.
Yeah.
You enjoyed that one, then.
Yeah,
I think you, it's, uh, it's something I think you would enjoy,
yes.
Uh-huh,
okay,
well, that's a good one to put on the list.
It, it's like most suspense movies,
what was
it was on T V recently, uh, FATAL ATTRACTION.
Uh-huh.
It's one that, once you've seen it once and, uh, the suspense there is not really you really can't see it again
Right,
okay.
so you know all the story and who did what and when it happened,
Uh-huh.
so once, once you seen one that's a suspenseful type movie like that, then it's, it's not good for a second watching particularly.
Uh-huh,
okay.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh
At least I don't think so
I don't think too many of them are anymore.
It's, it's a shame,
but, uh,
I don't know,
we've watched WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S any number of times
I know
It's just slapstick comedy
Oh, no
Oh
Sit there and laugh,
and, my one grandson and I,
my wife can't understand it,
but we like BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE which is another funny one
Oh, gosh.
Yeah,
we've heard about that one,
but we haven't seen that one either
So, well, it sounds like you and your grandson like the same kinds of movies.
Yeah,
we like to laugh
Oh, God.
I, I have a theory.
I like movies for entertainment.
I don't want to uh, go away depressed from watching a movie.
Right.
Right,
right.
I agree,
I agree.
Life's depressing enough
That's for sure
Well, I've certainly enjoyed talking with you.
Well, you, too, Jim.
Okay,
bye.
Thanks for punching in
and, uh
Have a nice weekend.
I hope you see a good movie soon.
Okay.
Okay.
Bye.
Bye-bye.

Uh, being a former drug user I, uh, I, I guess I have to say at this point, that I do approve of it.
Whoa.
Uh-huh.
Uh, because I know that, uh, in using drugs I was not a good employee.
Uh-huh.
And so I can see from the company's standpoint that there, uh,
whenever you are an employee of the company, you are using its assets,
and, uh, you are also under their liability, under the Workmen's Comp.
Uh-huh.
Uh, on my job we had a lot of Workmen's Comp cases
Where do you work?
Oh.
And, uh, it's also a retreading plant,
and that's where most of our, uh, injuries occur.
Uh-huh.
And what we do is we'll have a drug test if an, if a, a break or a man, uh, has an accident.
Then he's automatically, uh, given a drug test.
Right.
Do they do it, like, you know, within hours of the accident,
or is it?
Yes,
when he goes to the doctor the first time.
Yeah.
And so, that kind of, uh,
I don't know if it's been a deterrent or not, because we have, uh, just started using it oh, for the past year or so.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Now we've let some people go, uh, that we, was found that drugs were used in their system.
Now, I don't know how T E C would handle it.
They haven't pursued it, you know.
Uh-huh.
Uh, if there's some, uh, problem I know,
there was one guy that we tested for preemployment for drugs who absolutely swore up and down that it showed that he was using amphetamines,
and he went to a, a separate drug testing firm,
Yeah.
and they showed it negative.
Huh.
So I think the tests themselves are not really that cut and dried, you know.
Yeah.
Yeah,
I think that's probably true, too.
That's, that's, that's sort of scary.
Uh-huh,
really.
And then I also had a friend who was just around some people that were smoking cocaine.
Yeah.
And he tested positive on cocaine.
Now then you always wonder, well is he just saying that
Yeah,
yeah,
really,
really.
Yeah.
Yeah,
that's, that's a bad situation.
I think that probably, I think most companies now, as far as entry, you know, exams require that.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
I think they should.
Uh-huh.
I'm a T I employee
and and, and, uh, I'm, I'm really gung ho for it.
Uh-huh.
In fact I, you know,
some of the places now, um, like I B M don't allow them smoking, you know in, in the plant.
Uh-huh.
Right.
We, we have designated smoking areas.
Yeah.
But, um, I work in sort of a building that's, that's not really, well
it's on the campus of the T I facility,
but it's a little bit, you know, separated.
We lease the building.
And it's, it's a factory environment.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, they, they have designated smoking,
but it's just wide open,
it's not ventilated properly
Yeah.
and I think that's bad.
But as far as the drugs, you know, being in the factory kind of environment that way I think it's a, it's a definite, I think it's essential.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
Yeah,
because you're endangering everybody's lives if you if it's something like that.
Yeah.
In fact we've had the policy on just the random testing now for a couple years,
Uh-huh.
and, uh, I, I was giving my boss a hard time because I kept waiting for my name to came, come up, you know,
they never, they never called me,
they never, you know,
and finally, the day we declared war was my time
You're kidding
No
And so, and, and my boss has, has gone for about like three times, I think.
And I told him he's obviously in a high risk group
The executives, right?
Right,
right,
and of course, you know, they did being moved around and making specifically single them out when we started, you know, that they were going to do all them first.
The executives?
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Wouldn't that be  awful if you were  if you were using, and, and oh, lose your job and everything.
Which I thought was interesting
Oh, man,
yeah.
Ooh, yeah.
I can't believe I was so brazen before.
I, like I say, I'm a former drug user,
Uh-huh.
but, uh, I, I, well, I, I accepted Christ as my Lord and Savior,
and so I don't use drugs any more.
Oh, what kind of drugs did you use,  if you don't mind?
Uh, marijuana, cocaine  and amphetamines.
Wow!
Um, yes,
uh-huh
And all on the job, too.
Really?
You know,  it had gotten that bad.
Well, it's really lucky that you got away from that.
Really,
Cause that's really,  downward spiral.
it's, it's
life is  so much more enjoyable.
Uh-huh.
And I was losing jobs just from doing a poor job, you  know.
Yeah.
Yeah,
that's, that's it.
I mean, you know, there's all kinds of drawbacks, much less the drug testing.
Yeah.
Just life in general.
Uh-huh,
that's right.
Yeah,
well, well I'm definitely for it.
Yeah.
Plus, you know, you, you want to think that, that you're working with people who are not only putting out their fair share, but that are not endangering your life,
That's right.
in  some cases
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
like,  uh, my husband, uh, several years back, worked for Motorola.
Uh-huh.
And they had, you know,
I mean it was a chemical handling type.
Oh, goodness.
Yeah,
I mean, and they have, they have some serious chemicals out there you know,
Yeah.
like they have emergency shower where you just run in there and strip off and dump water, you know, that kind of thing.
Yeah.
And they had people out there using all sorts of drugs handling those chemicals.
Oh, my gosh.
And that's really, that's really frightening.
Yeah.
So I think some place, you know, places like that, it should be like mandatory like, you know, on, on a, on a greater frequency than maybe, just, you know, paper pushers like,  like I am.
Uh-huh.
Right,
I would think  there would be.
Well, well you'd think so
but, uh,
But they weren't?
I don't know if they do it till yet.
Isn't that awful.
Because when he was at,
course now it's been years now, because it was before, it was even before they had the, the designated smoking  type stuff,  you know, at T I.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
I forgot what,
I guess it was like eighty-four, eighty-five something like that.
Yeah.
And they, at that time, they had no testing whatsoever.
Huh.
So that's scary
Yeah.
That reminds me of, uh,
I have a friend who was telling me about her brother who gets high all the time,
and I have just casually asked her what he did for a living.
And she said, Oh, he's the supervisor of this chemical land fill,  you know  where they go and dump all this toxic stuff.
Oh, Lord.
Oh.
And I just, you know, went, Oh, where?
Yeah,
should we move?
Let me move as far away  as possible.
Ooh.
Yeah,
That's awful.
But, I'm proud, though, that, that, um, you know, I grew up in the sixties,
and back then it was popular you know,
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
but people have really wizened, you know, become wise about drugs
Yeah.
and they really have a good campaign for the young people, you know.
Uh-huh.
They know it's not smart,
so. So, I guess it was just a generational thing.
Yeah.
Yeah,
peer group is the other way now instead of,
That's right,
and that's good.
Uh-huh,
that's,
That's the best way to stop it.
Yeah,
that, it really is.
Yeah,
well, I think we did it.
Okay.
So it's good talking to you.
Well, I enjoyed talking to you,  Cathy.
Yeah,
bye-bye

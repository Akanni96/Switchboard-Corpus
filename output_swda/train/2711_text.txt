So, the topic is vacations?
Alright,
that's a good, that's a good topic, huh?
I think so.
I enjoy them.
Where did you go on your last vacation?
Uh, the last was back down to Lubbock to visit parents.
It was,
What?
The last one was back down to Lubbock, Texas,  to visit  family.
Uh-huh,
yeah.
Uh.
But that's not the tradition for us.
Oh, yeah.
What's your out of the, out of the state type,
where do you like to go?
Uh, we enjoyed Yellow Stone real well last year.
Really?
Yeah.
What kind of, uh, vacation spots are there in Colorado?
Oh, Rocky Mountain National Park.
Uh-huh.
It's, it's just like any of the other national parks.
It,
you know, there's camping and fishing and hiking and wildlife watching
and,
I think my parents took me there when I was real young.
We went to Colorado Springs and, uh, Rocky Mountain National Park.
It was real pretty.
Oh, it's,
Got to see Pike's Peak.
Yeah,
we usually try and drive up there, oh, once every year or two.
You drive by yourself up there?
Sure.
Oh, wow.
To the top the of the peak,
sure.
Oh, that's tough.
I don't, I don't think I could do that
Oh, it's not bad at all.
It's, it's a beautiful drive.
Oh.
Now I admit up there, the altitude is kind of interesting,
Yeah,
yeah.
You know you get a little lightheaded and giddy,
but it's fun. You know, take along a picnic lunch
and,
Sure is pretty up there.
Oh, we love it.
You have mountains all around you?
Uh, no,
Uh-huh.
you know, it's right there at the very foot of the Rockies.
You know, and once a week we drive up into the mountains, usually, you know, usually once a week, once every other week.
Wow,
that's neat.
I'm jealous
There's hills in Texas.
Yeah,
well, I enjoy hills, in Texas too.
I've been in Sherman.
No,
I haven't,
you?
Uh, once to Mexico City,
but just a little day thing on business.
Uh-huh.
I went to, uh, the Bahamas last year, on a cruise for my honeymoon.
Uh, that's nice.
It was really neat,
I had never been out of, really, out of Texas or out of Indiana much, out of the United States.
I'm from Indiana
so,
Did you enjoy it?
What?
Did you enjoy it?
Yeah,
it was great.
Uh-huh.
It was really pretty down there.
Uh, got to eat some different kinds of foods and meet people from a different culture
and,
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
really did.
There,
in fact, one, uh, family that sat at our table every meal was from London,
Oh.
and  they had never been to the United States,
so they were really enjoying it
and they were telling us about all their trips.
Huh.
They had been to Disneyland,
and it was neat to meet different people.
So the place that I went, that we've gone on vacation that I think I enjoyed the most,  was  Seattle.
Uh-huh.
Oh, really?
I've heard it's really pretty up there.
Well, we, uh,
was, two years ago,  we  went during the drought.
Uh-huh.
Oh.
I'm sorry, three years ago.
It had been dry for a whole week.
Oh, wow.
It didn't rain for a whole week.
Yeah
that would have been nice.
That would have been best time to go.
Yeah,
somehow we picked the right time and, uh, walked down on the wharf,
and I think we ate seafood every meal for, well, not quite every meal, but most meals for a week.
Uh-huh.
Uh, it was wonderful.
Uh, the Pacific Science Museum, the little girl really enjoyed.
It's very interesting.
Pacific Science?
Yeah.
Really?
Yes.
It was, it was super,
and, uh, went to the Seattle Aquarium.
Uh-huh.
And it's right down there, on the, right there on the ocean, and down there on the wharf by the piers and all,
and you walk down in a dome, a glass dome,
Uh-huh.
and  the bay is circulating over your head,
and you,  and you  can watch the fish swim by and sharks
Oh, wow.
and oh it's,
Oh, neat.
Yeah,
and then there's walrus and sea lion and porpoises, and oh, it's,  it's  amazing.
That's the vacation you recommend, huh?
Oh, absolutely.
Yeah.
Without a doubt.
Seattle is beautiful,
and the mountains,  the mountains to the east  of Seattle,  are  just incredible.
Yeah,
I've heard it is.   Uh-huh.
Really?
I rode a ferry for the first time in my life.
Oh, wow.
You know, up there, you go from the mainland to a whole bunch of islands around there by ferry,  Instead  of by bridge.
Uh-huh.
And you drive your car on.
You park your car,
you set your brake.
You walk upstairs
and you have a beer,  or  coffee, or whatever, depending on the time of day.
It's amazing.
And your car is on a ferry?
Yes.
And it goes across with you?
Yes.
That's really neat.
Yeah,
yeah.
And there are people, literally that everyday, take the ferry, you know, and drive, on to it,
To work?
yeah,
live on an island off, off shore from Seattle.
That's really wild.
And, you, uh,
everyday they drive on the ferry.
They go upstairs and have their morning coffee.
Huh.
Take, for the twenty to, hour and ten minutes that it takes to get across and, you know, depending on where it is.
Hour and ten minutes?
Well, in some places, you know,  in  some areas, you know, depends on how far they are commuting.
Yeah.
That's really interesting.
Oh, it, it's strict,
I'm, I'm a West Texan.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
You know, it's, it's a different life style than we are used to.
Yeah,
it is.
I've been wanting to go to the West Texas, and see different parts of Texas, because I haven't lived here very long,
and I haven't really seen much.
So what are some good things in Texas to go visit?
Oh, Galveston.
Galveston?
Yes,
I liked Galveston real well,
uh, there's, uh,
one of the areas down there close to Galveston is,
I forget the name of the island,
Uh-huh.
but  it's a bird sanctuary,  with  all kinds of wild birds. Whooping and sand hill cranes, and ducks and pelicans
Uh-huh.
and it's very pretty.
Uh-huh.
Of course, you haven't lived until you have been to San Antone, to the,  to  the Alamo.
Yeah.
Boardwalk and all that.
Yeah,
the river walk.
Oh, it's,
Yeah.
And you need to go in the Spring when all the flowers are in bloom all up and down through there.
Oh, it's just simply beautiful.
I've heard it's really pretty.
And, of course, always when I lived in West Texas, had to annually go down to San Antone just,
Really?
Yeah,
and go to, uh, Lone Star,
and uh, you know make my annual pilgrimage to the Lone Star Brewery,
Yeah
You know, go across the border and all.
Uh, the Davis Mountains are interesting,  out  there in West Texas.
Uh-huh.
Down by Big Bend?
Yeah,
yeah.
Uh, now the right time of year to go there is in the middle of winter,  because,  there's a beauty to the desert that it can most be, it can best be appreciated when you are not burning up.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
You know, whenever you've been kind of cold where you are at. It's most enjoyable,  to  get, you know, to get warm.
Um.
Uh-huh.
That's nice,
uh, down there, in the lower Rio Grande Valley closer to where the Rio Grande empties into the Gulf, that's interesting.
I love the Texas Hill Country.
Yeah.
And, uh, Austin is neat for, for an occasional visit.
I've heard to go to Austin too.
A lot people say to go down there.
Yeah,
yeah
it's a fun few days. Uh,
What's there to see in Austin?
Oh, U T is real pretty.
Uh-huh.
Uh, there's a lot of little limestone lakes and caverns around that area, Marble Falls and all.
That's real pretty.
Uh, I would say definitely go see that part
and, uh, I'd say go to, uh, Midland once, just for the heck of it.
I don't know why, exactly.
But, uh, you know, find out when they are holding the petroleum fair, uh,

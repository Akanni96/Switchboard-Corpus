All right.
Well, uh, quite a few
and they're varied.
They don't, uh, uh, encompass, uh, many handcrafts like knitting and that kind of thing.
Uh-huh.
But, I do, uh, quite a bit of wreath making
and my dogs are my hobbies.
I do a lot of gardening.
I go to estate sales, which takes up a lot of time.
Uh-huh.
Now, what do you mostly do
Well, mostly right now I'm a, I do a lot of sports and stuff like that is my hobbies and do a lot of things with my family as much as possible.
We're, uh, we're about to take the kids to go roller skating and a birthday party and stuff,
Oh,
so.
boy
Yeah.
That  should be fun.
Yeah.
Fun for them.
Yeah.
How old are they?
Uh, I've got a little girl who's six and a little girl that's three.
Well, I think that's better than having that party at home
Yeah.
Well, uh, this is a friend's party
and they, they rented,
or, you know, they,
the party,
they, uh, just rent skates and stuff for the kids.
Yeah.
So,  uh  they're,  they're looking forward to it.
And,  the  the, the skating rink does the rest practically,  I  guess.
Yeah,
yeah.
Uh-huh
Boy, what a help that is.
Yeah
So, uh,
What kind of,
how long have  you lived in North Carolina?
Well, not that long.
Really?
Uh, just since October.
We moved here from Enid, Oklahoma.
Oh.
Uh-huh.
So, uh, we are, we're originally from Virginia, this part of the country.
Uh-huh.
But, we did spend twenty years in Norman and Enid and loved it.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
But, we needed to get back, uh to our older parents.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
But, I am loving it
The weather is divine.
Really?
Yes.
uh,
did you like Oklahoma,  while you  were there?
Oh, yes.
Very much.
Yeah.
Um, what did you all do?
Well, my husband was with, uh, begins to be much clearer, a lot less back ground noise and University of Oklahoma and,  Phillips  University in Enid.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
And then he went with, uh, a family corporation that had, uh, has oil and ranching and varied enterprises.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, he just quit a perfectly good job and came, we came East
Really?
Yes.
So, is, uh, is he working there then
or
Yes.
Uh-huh.
He's doing, uh, quite a bit of consulting work and,  has been  offered a permanent position
Oh, uh-huh.
and he's contemplating
Uh-huh.
He, he's liking this free time actually
Oh, yeah.
It's just wonderful after all,  these  years of working.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, how did, how did you get, uh, hooked up with the T I switchboard thing?
Um, a gal who works, uh, with T I on this project
Uh-huh.
I think she's a temporary worker
Uh, mother is my best friend  in Virginia
Oh, I see.
So we have spread the word a little bit in this part of the country.
I see.
Uh-huh
my wife has talked more than I have, uh,
she's talked to four, five different people.
It seems like she hasn't talked to anybody from Dallas.
In fact, she's talked to a couple of people from North Carolina, I  think.
Really?
Yeah.
Uh, what is her name?
Her name's Tina
Yeah.
Well, I haven't talked to her.
I haven't,  I  haven't talked to a Tina yet
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
uh, the, the call was probably for her.
They wouldn't accept my, uh, T I N number,
so we put hers in.
But, uh, uh, like I said, we're getting, getting the kids ready to go to the birthday party,
Yeah.
so.
Yeah.
But, uh, some of
yeah,
I, I've only talked to one or two
and they've, they've all been in Dallas.
But, she hasn't talked to anybody, in Dallas, yet.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So, that's interesting.
Well, you haven't told me, uh, what sports that you are active in.
Well, the sport I like best probably is basketball.
But, uh, I guess I'm probably better at softball.
And so I'd,
like during the summer months it's, occupies quite a bit of my,  time.
Yes.
But, I play in a couple of leagues and, and occasionally in a tournament or something on a weekend.
But, my family usually goes with me.
We try to do everything we can together.
Well, I think that's, uh, easy entertainment for a,  family,  too.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, they, uh,
a good friend of mine that plays on one of my teams, we, uh,
that's usually the team I play on with the tournaments and stuff,
and they have a couple of kids that are almost my kids age.
So they play together,  pretty well
Under the stands.
and,
Under the, bleachers.
Yeah.
Yeah,
pretty  much.
And, uh, Tina enjoys, uh, the other lady, real well.
So they,
you know, that's kind of nice.
It's like getting together with,  them.
Yes.
Well, it's getting,  a little hot,  isn't it?
So to speak.
It,
Yeah.
Well, it's been raining a lot here so far.
So we haven't really had any kind of real heat.
I think it's going to be warm enough this afternoon, we were noticing a while ago it's already eighty in, in the house.
So, it looks like an air conditioner,  day.
Yeah.
But,
It sure does.
Or maybe this evening anyway.
Yeah.
It,
yeah,
but, you know, I'm sure you're familiar with that living,  here.
Very,  much so.
We go, we go through Enid, you know, quite a bit.
We go to Tulsa from time to time.
And my, my parents live in southern Illinois.
So, we drive,  up  there.
Yeah.
And, well, lot of times we take seventy-five
and, uh, it seems like, seems like that goes through Enid, I know,
No.
No
it doesn't.
I've either seen the signs or,
Enid is, uh,
it's in the northwest.
It's, uh, directly across the straight, uh, state from Tulsa.
Uh,
Um.  I know I've seen, the sign somewhere.
Sure you have.
Yes.
Well, Enid is, not, uh, an unknown little city.
Yeah.
It, uh
Right.
an awful lot of people know where it is, or have been there.
And it,  was,  uh, a very, uh, self-sufficient, uh, wealthy uh, town, for a long time, anyway You know until, uh, everything happened,
Uh-huh.
Uh.
Uh-huh.
the bottom fell out.
But,
Oh, uh-huh.
it's beginning to do well.
But, there's a lot of, uh, old time wealth there that, has helped to stabilize things.
Oh, uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
So, uh, how
you said you've just lived in North Carolina just like,  six  months then is,

Yes.
Something like that.
And you really like,  it  there, huh?
Oh.
I've heard so many people talk about that area.
I've never been there
Well  it's, it's and children in the  pretty.
but they sure,  say it's pretty.
The weather is wonderful.
Uh, this winter we,
it was just,
we had so many wonderful days.
And,
Uh-huh.
uh,  I,
if it got to be forty degrees, I decided it was too cold to, to walk the dogs
Isn't it, funny how how, your standards change
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It really does.
My wife and I spent a couple years, uh, doing church work up in the state of Washington right,  on  the coast.
Yes.
And it rains, you know, a lot there.
Sure.
But, you get used to it.
I mean, it's like a fine mist all the time
and it doesn't really,
it gets to where it doesn't bother, you.
Well, foggy and, misty.
Really?
It,
The moss grows, on the trees in the woods up , eight, ten, feet.
Uh-huh.
Right.
Right.
Yeah.
That's the way it is, was,  there, too.
Yeah.
I  think, however, that's like February.
Uh, I know it did it all February.
And some people said to me, "Well, that's our wintertime."
Oh, uh-huh.
Well, I know you,  need  to go.
But,
And I've enjoyed talking to you.
Well, I have enjoyed talking to you, too.
It was nice,  to talk to  you.
Thanks so much.

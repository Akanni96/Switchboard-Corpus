Well, I know that, uh,
I have only like two or three favorite television shows.
Uh-huh.
I think one of my favorite then is from the guy Stephen, is it Brochco, who does like L A LAW
Oh, yeah.
Uh-huh.
uh-huh,
and, uh, he also did HILLSTREET BLUES.
Yeah,
I like those type of shows.
Yeah,
we really enjoy that too.
Uh-huh.
Uh, I don't get a lot, to watch a whole lot of T V.
We have a couple of young children,
and so we're usually outside,
Uh-huh.
and so it's usually the nine o'clock shows that if we get them in bed, we usually watch that,
and L A LAW is one of my favorites.
Oh, yeah,
me, too.
I know,
they, uh, I think they're different than a lot of other shows of which they have like the re runs in the middle of the season
Yeah.
and then towards the end when everybody else is showing reruns, they start showing some of their newer stuff.
Yeah
So I thought that was really interesting the way that they did that.
Oh, and so you must watch a lot of, uh, Disney or cartoons then?
Well, we have on SESAME STREET and MISTER ROGERS, that kind of stuff,
and I think those programs are really good for children.
I know that both of mine have probably learned quite a bit from there.
Uh-huh.
It's kind of nice to know that they're just going to be seeing, you know, not a lot of violence and that kind of stuff
Right.
and they usually, uh, show a lot of things that really teach them different things about the world.
So.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
My older son, he's going to be five,
and he's more into watching the cartoons and that kind of stuff now.
Oh, that's true,
that's true.
Well, I noticed that, my kids are, uh, older now,
they're uh, getting close to the teenage years.
Uh-huh.
But they did,
we watched all of MISTER ROGERS and everything,
but even some of your, uh, cartoons can be very violent
Yeah.
and, you know, they talk about death,
and, we were watching, uh, oh gosh, BUGS BUNNY just last night
Oh, yeah.
and, um, I think it was on, I have to remember which channel,
but anyway, uh, we were watching that
and it was talking about opera,
and they showed like what they thought an opera would be,
and one of the things was to kill the rabbit, kill the rabbit
Oh.
and I thought, Oh, how violent, you know, to kill the rabbit.
So he ended up killing the rabbit in the end, uh,
but then of course, the rabbit comes back to life and says, well, see this is how an opera is supposed to be.
And I thought, gee whiz, if a little kid was watching this, you know, that would be pretty violent even for a small child.
Well, yeah,
and you know, they, especially boys, I mean, they're always talking about shooting and killing and all that kind of stuff
Uh-huh.
and I don't think that they really realize that death is forever, you know.
Right.
And showing them something like that really doesn't teach them that it is.
That's right.
That's right.
Well, I don't think cartoons portray that
but like,
No,
and to get them to feel like that that's just pretend, I think is the hardest part, you know.
Yeah,
Yeah.
A cat has nine lives
Yeah.
but they don't,
they just have one like we do
Oh, so that's really funny
but, uh we've gotten,
uh-huh,
go ahead.
I was just going to say, I know that, at least before our kids were born, we used to always enjoy watching the COSBY SHOW,
Thursday nights usually had pretty good, with that, and as far as very good comedy.
Uh-huh.
I like to watch DESIGNING WOMEN if the kids are in bed by then.
Yes,
Yes,
yeah,
that's true,
that's a good show.
I used to watch, uh, DALLAS.
We're, we're in Dallas.
yeah.
I used to watch DALLAS, years ago.
And somewhere in the middle I got, uh, bored,
and, uh, so I, in fact, I didn't even watch the finale.
Uh, you know, that's about how disinterested I had become.
Yes.
Well, I did watch it just to see what it was
Uh-huh.
and it wasn't really that great.
So.
Well,
I think, after a while, they just kind of, you know, there's no new stuff they can do,
uh-huh.
they've done everything dirty in the book you know,
Yep.
so,
Yep,
I know,
I know.
Was it actually based on a book?
Well, no,
I imagine,
Oh, but you were just talking about,
okay,
okay,
Everything you could think of, you know had a hard time,
Yeah,
right.
and I think maybe with DALLAS, as far as, they lost a lot of characters that had been around at the first.
That's true,
that's true.
Where,
I don't know,
I never watched KNOTS LANDING,
but I think they've had a lot of their characters stay around.
Stay.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
You know, and if you notice on DALLAS, they lost all the women.
Yeah.
Yes.
So the men mainly stayed
but the women were the ones who left,
and I thought that was very interesting and wondered, kind of wondered about that.
Uh, well, anyway that's a whole new issue
Yeah
Oh.
Oh, goodness
so. Anyway. I don't know if our five minutes are over yet
But we, uh, we also have the paid, uh, television channels.
Uh, the only thing I don't like about it, especially with teenagers, is that all the violence, the sex, the nudity and the curse words you know.
Uh-huh.
And so, I know they didn't pick up these curse words from me.
So, uh, they had to have picked them up from, uh, the T V.
Yeah.
One nice thing though about the cable company we use, they have, uh, they have that little parental, uh, uh, key,
Where you can lock up, the channel or whatever?
Yeah.
Yeah,
uh-huh.
So, I, I have that at home,
and I keep the keys with me.
Yeah.
And that's about the only way that I can, that I can do it.
Because their natural curiosity, you know, to go towards that way and want
Yeah.
yeah.
And I don't know the way the generations are growing up now,
I mean I just think they watch so much more T V.
I try to limit what they watch.
They aren't sitting in the house watching T V all day because I think it's good for them to have physical activity and that kind of stuff, too.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
Yeah.
And especially in the summer time we aren't in the house very much in the evenings.
It's the only cool time to be outside
That's true,
well, and here lately it hasn't been that cool anyway with the humidity being so high.
Well, true,
Well, it was nice talking to you.
Well, it was nice talking to you, too.
Okay,
talk with you later.
Okay.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.

They're still  making albums.
Huh.
Wow,
I didn't know that.
Uh-huh.

That's interesting.
In fact, I mean there are people you know that basically just follow them around, from city to city on tour selling tie dye and  things like that.
Uh-huh.
Uh,
Cause they are on up there in age, aren't they?
Yeah,
they're, they're like late forties, early fifties,
but you know like whenever one of them dies off they get a replacement
Okay.
Alright.
You know, they seem to have a really bad time with keyboard players.
They keep on dying
and they keep on replacing them
and the new one's in this thirties you know. Uh,
Oh, alright.
But, uh,
Cause they look pretty rough.
I mean, I've seen like picture of them
and they just,
Yeah.
Well, they don't actually look as rough as the Rolling Stones.
They just,
I don't know if you saw the tour posters of the Rolling Stones when they last toured,
but it looked like leather day at the geriatric,
Yeah,
I mean cause they just,
All their faces were just all shriveled,
Uh-huh.
Yuck looking, I mean
Uh-huh.
uh.
I mean it just just looked like they, got a bunch of retirees and put them in leather jackets and blue jeans.
Uh-huh.
Well are you into that that rock music, you know, all that druggy stuff and all that I mean?
Well, uh
You know what I am saying
like, I mean like they come on the stage
and like, you know, you,
they don't even know they are there. You know.
They are just so  out of it.
Actually, I prefer my,  my performers to be pretty sober, you know, just uh, just so that, you know, that if they're jamming, you know, that they don't just lose themselves and you know, go into lala land.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
So, I just don't, I just don't like  you know.
Uh-huh.

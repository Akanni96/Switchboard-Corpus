Okay. Uh,
we keep a monthly budget.
I just recently stopped working so I can be home with my kids
so we keep a monthly budget
and we try to stick to it
are kitchen noises  I know.
It, it's really difficult here. All because there's always something breaking.
Car needs tires  or you know, something.
Yeah,
yeah.
That's the kind of things  that throw you off.
Uh, uh, we do ours more monthly than long range.
Uh, we, uh,
my husband gets paid once a month
Uh-huh.
and when he gets paid, I pay all the bills.
Uh-huh.
And out of his check they take a savings
and out of my check, they take savings and retirement both, out of both checks.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
So, as far as extra savings, we really don't have that much extra to save.
Yeah.
Uh, his check, once a month, pays all the bills.
My check, weekly, buys groceries and gas and you know, that kind of thing
Oh, how nice.
Yeah.
and it works out real well that way.
We don't run into a lot of problems
Yeah,
yeah.
but  budgets  are horrible.
Well,  I know.
We do,
my husband gets paid twice a week
and so we pay all of the little bills, uh,  one  paycheck and then like the mortgage and the electric bill, you know, those big bills the second second pay
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
and then, again, he does have a savings that comes out, you know, for  Christmas and stuff, that kind of thing.
Yeah,
yeah.
When the car insurance is due and you call the credit union and tell them, well send me some money
Yeah,
that kind of thing.
Yeah.
it, uh, it would be nice if we didn't have to touch the money he has taken out and put in savings
but  we do.
But it's nice  that it's there, you know.
Yeah,
it,
I'm just glad that it is there for car insurance, medical bills, whatever happens .
Yeah.
Yeah.
But, uh,
Yeah.
It's nice  that it's there.
I know.
But I,
you,
it's just really is difficult.
Uh, neither one of us has had a raise in a couple of years.
Yeah.
And, of course, the cost of living keeps going up so much.
Yeah.
Groceries are outrageous
and I keep saying my check does less and less
but,
Yeah,
yeah.
That's kind of how I felt when I was working because it seemed like we spent more.
Uh-huh.
We bought more things
and it seemed like we spent more.
Then a lot of it was going to, uh, daycare and that kind of thing.
Yeah.
So it just seems like with me staying home, we had that big cut
but we save more
I don't know how
and I don't know why
but  we
Well  I, uh, I know that since I do work, I buy a lot of quicker cuts of meat and, uh well the frozen things  for the microwave and things like that.
it seems like we do.
Yeah.
Yeah,
you kind of try  and buy bigger quantities.
And I'll stop by the deli and pick up, uh, chicken or whatever. Where if I did not work, I'm sure that the grocery bill could be managed a lot, a lot, uh, better.
Yeah.
That's how I felt too.
It just,
you could take a little longer.  And  just watch a little bit more I guess.
Yeah.
Well,
I guess  that's kind of like the way we do.
We,
I, I don't, I don't know how it comes out.
It just seems like we save a little bit more whereas,  where I was working,
Well, I'm sure you do.
Uh, I do not, well I do not have to pay child care during the winter.
My son's old enough that he likes to come home uh, from school.
Oh.
But in the summer he's still young enough that I cannot leave him by himself.
Yeah.
So in the summer I have that extra
and ours is seventy dollars a week plus all activities
Yeah.
and that's usually movies one day, skating one day
Yeah.
Swimming one day
It adds up.
Yes.
So you usually end up paying close to eighty dollars a week
and that's a lot of money.
Yeah,
it is
It is,
yeah.
But you know,  if they're going to be in daycare then they need to have some activities other than just being there.
Uh-huh.
do you have two children?
I have two.
One is four and a half
and the other one's two and a half,
so.
Well they're expensive too.  Uh, just the  outgrowing of their clothes
Yes
so  I'm sure the budget,
Yeah,
that,
yeah.
I just came back to find jeans for the little one
and it does add up.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But, uh,
And medical bill.
Yeah.
Although the insurance we had was good, uh, when Thomas was younger. A lot of the stuff had to be paid up front
and then you were reimbursed.
So it was nice when you'd get a couple of hundred dollar check  from the,  insurance,
but in the meantime you had to put out the money first.
Yeah,
yeah.
But,
Well,  that, that's, that's hard.
Yeah,
it is.
But  I'm enjoying my stay home for the little time that I can
Oh, I would too.
For the,
I would, I would advise anyone that could possibly do it to, to,
I know it's not forever
and that's what's so sad
but,
Well, you probably wouldn't want to do it forever.
I don't know though

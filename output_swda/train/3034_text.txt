Okay.
I hope you know more about the subject of baseball
and where they're going than I do
Oh, I know a little bit about it.
I'm not a die-hard fan
but I, I enjoy the,
I like the Boston Red Sox myself.
Well, I,
of all the sports that there are, that there is, I like baseball the best.
However, I haven't been to a baseball game in years,
but I have kept, uh, my eye on the Rangers.
Uh-huh.
You know
and I guess they were doing pretty good up to a point,
and then they kind of fell on their face
Well, with, uh,
their biggest point of interest has been Nolan Ryan not the rest of the team lately,
so.
Correct,
right.
Right
Oh, it's amazing.
They're so astronomical I can't even imagine that kind of money.
Right.
You know it's just, uh, phenomenal
Well, fortunately the Red Sox, last time I saw the paper earlier this week, were in first place and doing quite well.
Well, good.
Um, I've been really busy at work this past week
and normally on my way into work I'll pick up a newspaper
and, uh,
so every day I'll have a newspaper at work,
and when I take a break, I'll take a look at the newspaper.
But this week I've been so busy I didn't even bother to stop
I understand.
I understand.
But hopefully, hopefully next week I'll get back to my normal routine.
Okay.
Uh, you are involved with T I uh, speech, um, recognition?
Well, not really.
I, um I work at laboratory.
How did you find out about it?
Oh, okay.
From, uh,
I'm an officer in the Air Force,
I see.
Interesting.
Oh, great.
And, uh, the speech laboratory does some work with, uh, T I, at, uh, not in my office
I see.
but, uh, in my division they do, quite a bit of speech work.
Uh-huh.
Well, that's good.
Well, that's interesting.
And the topics are interesting, uh,
they run a whole gamut of, of, uh, subjects,
and, uh, I think we can address every topic,
but the depth of knowledge is quite different.
Sure.
Sure.
So, uh, when they chose baseball,
I mean, I'm, I'm, I can understand baseball, you know,
I don't understand football.
Uh-huh.
Oh, I prefer to,
I, I like,
I never used to really like watching football that much
but more and more these days I'm, I'll like a football game,
but I've always liked baseball.
I, I prefer to watch, um,
I guess I'm one of the few people that also prefers baseball to football.
And I, I'd much rather go to a baseball game than to a football game.
Well, I, I can relate to baseball because I used to play baseball.
But I can't relate to football because I've never, played football and, and don't, and have any interest,
Uh-huh.
and I said if I ever had a son, he would not play football.
And, uh, I had four daughters
so that wasn't a question,
but now I have a grandson that you know, is gung ho for, uh, football.
Uh-huh.
Well,
Well, there's injuries in a lot of sport.
I understand that,
I'd, I,
but I think the, they happen more in football.
I think the odds are cut down.
Uh-huh.
You know, I, I know they can get hurt in baseball too.
The bat is a very heavy object, can do a lot of damage
but, uh, I think that they have a, a lower racial of injuries, ratio of injuries in baseball.
it's true.
I, I would say that baseball tends to be one of the less, troublesome sports,
Because
Yeah.
but, uh, for some people it's just, uh, uh,
A love for them.
Well, that,
not so much that
but, uh, even in baseball you can,
like when I played baseball when I was growing up, I had trouble, uh, uh, just throwing the ball because I very, I was always very strong
and I
when I was young I could throw harder, than my, uh, like ligaments and all that should have been allowed to.
Uh-huh.
I see.
And so I was always throwing my arm out and, uh, having trouble.
Uh-huh.
I, and I was a catcher
so I was constantly throwing back to the pitcher and then down to second base and all and that kind of stuff.
So I,
that was always a problem for me was just, just the constant throwing,
so.
Did you, did you sustain any permanent, uh, injury with that?
No,
I did that wrestling
Oh.
Oh, okay.
No,
I'd,
well, I, I, uh, always been quite an athlete and doing different things
and, um, the other thing was I'd never really let injuries stop me.
But interestingly enough you mentioned football, is like,
now I won't play football anymore because of the, uh, the separated shoulder wrestling,
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
so. Um, but I stood the, stood the injury wrestling,
but it,
as long as I let it heal, it never really bothered me
then playing football this fall, I, it was just flag football too. I separated it again
Uh-huh.
and it seemed to be, like the straw that broke the camels back,
Oh, boy.
so.
Uh-huh.
Well, I have, uh, I have a broken arm that I had since I was three.
It was never set right.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, uh, I liked bowling as a, as a kind of a relaxing sport.
And, uh, one of the men that was in our on our league, uh, noticed, uh, you know, uh, my broken arm and the way my ball would do.
And he says, let me show you how to use your arm to your advantage.
And so he brought me up from like a hundred and fifteen, I had my high game of two eighty-seven.
My God.
So, uh, yeah
Um, it was really funny, you know, that he would tell me where to stand and how to hold my arm and, and how to, uh, follow through with my, uh,
addressing that , to put the ball,
Uh-huh.
the, uh, pins.
So that was interesting.
So I really, um, I got a lot of, uh, recognition from the, uh, uh, the bowling league, I guess.
Uh-huh.
I'm not sure where all my pins came from,
but it's,
but that was quite awhile ago
but I, and I never pursued it.
And a lot of people said, well, you should have turned pro.
And I thought, no,
not
I don't,
my love wasn't there for the game.
I liked to as a, as a method of, uh, entertainment and I, uh, fellowship
Sure.
but outside of that, no.
I didn't.
And I, and I still, I like to bowl,
but, uh, I don't have, uh, Jack standing behind me to tell me what to do
Are you on, you on any leagues now?
No,
I'm not.
Oh.
No.
No, uh,
at T I they have a sponsor, a junior league achievement
and, uh, it's true bowling
and I've never, uh, shared that with them.
I would have to brush up on my bowling before I even tried to, uh, win a lot of money for the junior achievement, uh, organization.
Uh-huh.
But that's the only thing that I would, you know, be to do.
Right.
Well, my grandmother has been bowling for, gosh, maybe thirty, forty years.
I don't know,
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
a long time.
Uh-huh.
And she still, she's got to be,
Still carries a good uh, average?
Well, no,
she

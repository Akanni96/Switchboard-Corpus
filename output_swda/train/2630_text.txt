Okay
he did really decide to go?
Uh-huh,
sure
I'm familiar with it,
and it was a very difficult choice
And he, well, he must know, is he interested in law or medicine,
he must have a definite profession in mind.
Oh, okay,
Medium size,
aren't they?
Is he excited?
Very excited,
Wow,
I can,
I,
Uh-huh
while they're east coast, I mean, I don't know anything about their football,
but there you go.
Well, they're, they're, they're really very strong academic rather than, you know, big sports,
Yeah,
that's,
where, where you at?
We're outside of, uh, Washington in Maryland.
How about you?
Oh, okay,
I'm in, uh, suburban Dallas.
Uh-huh,
do you have children in,
No,
I don't,
I have a husband
We don't have any kids yet.
Okay, um,
About all I can say is I guess about picking schools, um, I guess, uh, if you don't know what you're going to do, liberal arts program is a good idea.
Well, I, I,
one of the, the advices we've given our children is that you can always learn a job
This is true,
uh, but what you can't learn, uh, on a job, is a good solid well-rounded education.
Right,
the humanities, the history, yeah,
That's right, you know,
the Renaissance man
Right,
right,
no,
no,
no
and, uh, and if you get that you can,
and if you do well, you can, you can learn a job,
Yeah,
but they, you know, if they learn the job and they can go into graduate school usually a company, it will, if it's worth it's weight, will subsidize,
That's exactly right.
That's right.
And,
So the advice we gave to them was, number one, visit the colleges that you're thinking about describe first of all, the size school that you might be interested in
Uh-huh.
This, this is true,
Yes.
And if you want to go away,
right,
do you want to go away,
how far from home do you want to be.
Right.
What do you want in a college.
Now my son is a national level competitive swimmer
Good.
so he wanted to swim in school,
but he did not want to be in a swim factory.
Okay.
So he wouldn't have gone to something like where we're at, they'd, in Austin, Texas, University of Texas,
That's right,
that's the University of Texas at Austin, or Stanford or something like that so he didn't even consider those.
Right.
Texas
yeah,
Okay,
well that's, I think the other thing is, too, um, I know I went to a, uh, city high school in Chicago
Uh-huh.
and a lot of the kids weren't as fortunate as say, my brother and I were,
and economics was the choice
Uh-huh.
um, sounds like your son has academically the standing to get into that type of school.
He is very, very strong academically,
yeah,
so, we've just,
but, you know, he had to look to see what kind of environment he liked,
Uh-huh.
and yet he, he did wind up having to make a choice.
He did apply to a large, you know, large group,
Yeah,
University of Penn,
I'm originally from Pennsylvania.
University of Pennsylvania,
It's got about nine thousand undergraduate.
Yeah,
that's strong,
I mean that's you know
Yeah,
Yeah.
and it's, it's, well, it's a little bit, I don't want to use the word wilder, that's not the word I want. Um, more diverse
Yes,
and it, but it does have the under, you know,
that's total undergraduate with five hundred graduate school, so that the, uh, the college of arts and sciences is, you know, I guess about four thousand.
At Williams or Pennsylvania?
At Williams,
At Pennsylvania.
At Pennsylvania.
Well how large is Williams?
Williams is an undergraduate school only
Right.
um, and it's a total of two thousand.
Well that's not bad.
Yeah,
so he knew the feeling because my other son is at Amherst which is fifteen hundred
Which is a lot,
Yeah.
and he had visited his brother at Amherst and knew that he liked the environment
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
but he did go on college visits,
and he liked,
That's the thing to do,
I mean, I, not having any children, my husband was an Ohio State person,
and, uh, that has something like either the first or second largest student population, like fifty thousand.
Yes,
yes
Combined .
it's large,
and they, both boys had decided no, that they did not want that.
Yeah,
that is too much,
and I mean, I, um, I can only say it's strange your son picked those kinds of college because I spent a year at Bennington in Vermont,
Oh, it's,
so you,
Um, and that was, this was twenty years ago
Uh-huh.
Showing my age,
And did you ever eat at the Blue Bin Diner?
Yes.
Oh my God,
where are you from,
well, let's not talk about that
No
but we've been there when whose gone up there.
It's, um, in that area.
I mean I just can't say enough about it.
Oh, it's, it
we went
and he was, you know, impressed by the clean air
and he, he met the students at both schools
and he liked them.
Well you know, um, my husband's an engineer and a strong , a strong liberal arts background with, uh, a graduate degree in a technical field will get him much further than say like a, a strong, um, business administration degree than with another M B A on top of it.
Uh-huh.
That's it.
The thing is if, if a person really knows very early on that they want to go in a technical field, than you're not, then it's probably good to go to, you know, to apply to a  school   with a good  technical program,
Uh-huh.
and they usually,  Yeah,
but they usually don't.
but, uh, for, if you're going into,
if you know engineering is the thing if, then you've got to at least take engineering.
Right,
but they,
no
but who does.
I mean, I think,  I think  all, I think the majority of people just don't know.
That's right.
No
he looked at criteria such as location, size of school uh,
Uh-huh.
No
he didn't apply to any school further,
the furthest away was Bowdoin, in Maine which is about twelve hours.
That's still pretty far though.
I mean a lot of kids just don't even want to go,
Yeah,
that was the furthest and then Kenyon in Ohio which was about six and a half hours
and Williams is about seven.
Oh, that's not too bad.
Yeah
so, well, I mean he, so it wasn't,
he, you know,
then the University of Pennsylvania is like two hours from here by train
and then Bucknell in mid-state Pennsylvania.
Yeah,
he will enjoy Williams I think and is a good academic,
Yeah,
and he will,
and if, it came down I mean, as he, he came,
he's been talking to them
and, and he came down
and one of the things that he said is, he went to Pennsylvania this weekend
and he had an absolutely marvelous time
Uh-huh.
he had a great time
but then he said, you know, it was such a good time that I almost got the feeling that their emphasis is on having fun.
That could very well be
and, So he's developing his, his, uh, internal instincts right now.
and he said it almost
I think it backfired.
That's good because I mean I'm sure what he said was true, that, uh, you,
So.
well actually that's one of the reasons I went to ,
Kenyon, he he made a good choice.
I went,
I, well I was supposed to,
but I spent a year in Vermont, my freshman year,
it was just too far away,
it was too different uh, the level of income of lot of the students
Uh-huh.
and their attitudes was just, um, beyond my,  um, in  terms of drugs, et cetera, which I thought was shocking.
Yeah,
yeah.
Of course, that period too was probably difficult.
Right,
yeah,
you're right
but then I went,
But I did, uh,
my advice to him, and my was that, uh, he had to really decide what he wanted out of college.
Yeah.
He had to look at himself.
Uh, in a larger school he had to realize that if he was going to screw around it, he could probably slip
and it wouldn't be caught up until it was too late where in a smaller school where, especially in a Kenyon or a Williams, where you see the professors around town all the time, you skip class in the morning and they see you,
Uh-huh.
And you're going to get a little bit more input than discipline
That's,
yeah,
yeah.
yeah.
And a swim coach is going to be right on top of you, uh, so that,
and he will know the professors in a small,
Well I don't know how to put this either in this way
and then it doesn't sound like your sons would need this
but I just think the other thing is with the way a lot of the youth is today, I think the refinement that they get I don't mean specifically or culture but just what you're saying, just a solid background because I just don't think at that age I just don't think that young people know what they want to do. You know
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
yeah.
That's right,
that's right.
and, um,
And, um, and it's just the personal contact where if you need help
That's right.
he had,
I told him to look to yourself.
Are you the kind of person that will go into a large college and if the professor says I've got office hours but you really don't feel that you know him because you're in a class of a hundred  that you're really  going to look him up
Right .
Yeah.
but if it's a class of fifteen and you need help, you know that it's much easier to do it and especially in the large schools they have lectures
This is very, very,
Oh.
and even though they may break it up into smaller groups Penn is known for having  graduate assistance teaching.
They have video lectures.
Yeah.
Video lectures.
They have  graduate assistants to teach the smaller groups.
This is true,
and I mean that is very ironic too that your son just made the,
did he just make the decision today?
he made the decision, uh, I'd say, about, uh, an hour and a half ago
How funny
Yeah,
I mean, that's so funny. I mean,
and, and, in fact, he had just an hour before that two, uh, recent graduates from Kenyon spent close to two hours talking with him
That's funny.
and, uh, I mean, and he, they were really nice,
and, but he said is, that they didn't tell him anything that he didn't know,
but they helped confirm his decision that a smaller school was better.
It was easy for him to rule out.
He knew what he didn't want
Yeah,
yeah.
that's exactly,
yeah.
Now is your other,
I mean we're talking about what you think,
but obviously you're experiencing it. Uh,
Did your other son, um,
My other son is just as happy as a bed bug.
A clam.
He,
the moment he knew, he, he decided early on that Amherst was the school.
He's a classical guitarist
Oh, wonderful.
and he decided, he also got into the graduate school of music as an undergraduate for classical guitar,
Uh-huh.
but he decided he was going to go to the, um the smaller now, and then graduate school later.
The smaller and the,
And they'll do fine in their studies,
and I'm sure they'll go on to graduate school,
Well, he's really, my older boy's real happy,
and he's minoring in English,
and he had thought about economics,
and he took a couple of courses in economics and decided that wasn't,
or is this early admissions?
He's, um, he's going to be a junior.
He'll be, he's finishing his sophomore year so he's double majoring.
So he's, So he's, yeah,
well sounds like you have two talented sons.
Well, you know, see the advice we give is to not limit yourself, especially this, you know, go to a school where you're not forced to make too many irrevocable decisions your first year or two.
I think, and a lot of people talk about,
and it's not the economics I solely zeroed in on,
but I think a lot of people think a lot of people think about the tuition level and what exactly are you getting in return
Yeah.
and I think that a lot of people shy away from the smaller colleges because of that,
and I think it's rather sad,
Well, one of the things we said is that they should pick the college,
this was our advice, too, irrespective of the cost. That somehow we would manage.
You are wonderful parents
Well, we place a real high priority on education in our family.
No,
and I agree,
I mean, my husband and I,
in fact, I'm taking my L S A T um,
I'm thirty something and taking my L S A T on June tenth.
Oh, good,
that's wonderful.
Oh, that's great.
The point being, and your sons will learn this from you, I'm sure, that, uh, no matter what age you are, you can learn
That's right,
that's exactly,
and, it sounds like they're going to, you know, they're,

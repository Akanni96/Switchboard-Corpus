Okay,
cars,
you, you
maybe this is a fantasy we can to talk about any kind of car, we want here
I want a Rolls Royce and a Cadillac
Hey,
that sounds like a great deal to me
You have great aspirations
Well, let's see
I, we just bought, uh, a seventy-three Mercedes that we have restored
Oh, that's great.
I'm, I'm a hobbyist too,
and it,
I like to work on cars too.
Yeah,
it has really been a lot of fun.
Uh, we found some guys that actually, you know, worked for a Mercedes dealership
and, uh, they also repair them for other the people on their off time so have, we, we have redone that thing from stem to stern, I mean inside, outside, you know, we've redone the body, repainted it, detailed it, so, you know, I really haven't thought much past that it seems like, you know,
Oh, that's good.
I don't know if I'll ever want another new car again, you know.
Was you,
why they, they didn't,
say buy it
they didn't necessarily say buy it new they just said, what would you buy, you know.
Maybe not.
Yeah,
that's true.
I, I don't know it just seems like, uh, you know, for what we've put into it I feel like that's something that might retain it's value a little bit more, than, you know,
Oh, sure,
a restored, vehicle is, is great, I think, certainly if it's an old Mercedes will be good.
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
right,
we, the one thing that, uh, we did decide as, it's, it's,
we wanted it to be as authentic as possible
but we did break down and put a C D player in it,
Well, that's great.
that's not quite authentic,
but at any rate that, that was one thing that I, one of the features that I did want,
I'd passed up on one and put a sunroof in it,
Oh, yeah,
you all, done a lot more,
I had to stop there.
when I talk about working on cars I sure don't do that.
Yeah,
well, of course, we do it ourselves
but, like I said, we were just lucky to find these guys that do it, you know,
Oh, okay.
they're, they just weren't really expensive,
Oh, that is good, acknowledgeable people.
and, uh, yeah, you know,
right,
and they work on it,
so, the things that can be done here they just come here to our home and, and work on it or work on it,
so,
That's amazing.
yeah,
it's, you know, it's really, it's really been nice.
We, uh,
I, I do all my own work, uh,
so, I, I have Chevies, mostly,
Uh-huh.
well, that's all I've got right now
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
I've got three Chevy V Eights.
I'm, uh, I'm, uh, a Chevy, I'm an American car person,
You're an American car person.
but I do like Mercedes.
Yeah,
yeah,
I, I have always had an American, American car
and, uh, I had a real, real bad experience with the Cougar that I had,
it was an eighty-two Cougar,
Yeah.
and, uh, I don't know,
I think it just soured me on it for some reason because I had trouble with it starting,
the engine blew up in it,
I had to replace the engine when it was only two years old so, you know, I, I thought what the heck, you know,
Yeah.
we'll try something different
so.
Well, I'm not a Ford person and never have been as a kid,
Yeah.
and, uh, I do like the V Eight engines
and I think the,
I went to the auto show with my daughter recently, down in Dallas
Uh-huh.
and, I, to me the American cars are far superior to the Japanese in styling, engines, right now, I mean,
Uh-huh.
Really.
Yeah,
right,
I'm not saying that they were, a couple of years ago.
yeah.
Yeah.
I would that that there's,
I see a marked improvement, you know, as far as, uh, what I've heard about performance and such, you know, so, uh, uh, hopefully it'll stay that way, I mean, you know,
Oh, yeah.
I'd, I'd, I would hate to see the American car industry suffering more than it already has you know, even though right now I'm not driving an American car,
Oh, yeah.
but, uh, I think,
I,
uh, you know, they said, they said what do we want to buy,
I, I'm, uh, not seriously thinking
but I, I would like to, put it in that category, uh, by a Cadillac
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
but I wouldn't, buy a new one
Yeah.
and, you know, of course, if I had the money I'd be happy to by a new one,
Yeah,
yeah.
but, uh, I do look for a one year old vehicle, with twenty some odd miles or whatever twenty thousand miles, whatever.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
twenty thousand,
yeah,
yeah.
Well, that's what my parents are avid Cadillac freaks.
They had, uh,
and I think my, my mother drives the SeVille now that's, uh, I guess it's a couple of years old,
and, uh, she had a SeVille before that that had the odd backs that was, that was so, uh,
Oh, yeah,
I remember those.
yeah,
yeah,
and she, it final just wore out
they had, they had purchased it,
I don't, can't remember how many years they had that car,
but she loved the styling of it.
That she may want to save, if she, she doesn't have it anymore.
No,
she sold it
and she,
That,
since they don't make them anymore, she, that could be turned into a classic, in, in ten, fifteen years, uh.
Yeah.
I know.
Yeah,
she kept telling herself that
and it's sort of a bone of contention between she and my dad because my dad said well, just let me take it down there and find out what's wrong with it,
I mean he came back with a new car
No,
he wanted new one ,
yeah,
right,
yeah.
Yeah,
I think he had an ulterior motive
he could just see, you know, dollar signs starting to flip by as far as repairs went
but, uh, they, they really are nice cars, there, there,
I'm still a full size person,
Yeah.
and I like a full size Cadillac,
I, I want one of those,
I think they are, I don't know, a classic
but they're, certainly not,
Uh-huh.
they haven't changed in about, uh, twenty years,
and, and they'll eventually phase them out
Yeah,
yeah.
and I sure would like one ever those, uh, uh, within the next five years, or so.
Yeah,
it seems funny you how within the last couple of years cars have gotten bigger again, you know,
Right.
they had, they've scaled everything down so much
and, uh, I have, I don't, I've never owned a really large car,
I don't know,
I think that Cougar was the biggest thing I ever had
and,
Well, even the Japanese cars are bigger too
but, uh,
Yeah,
I've never had a
now the Lexus are very nice looking cars, you know.
I've never had, a Japanese car,
I, I've had friends who had them,
Uh-huh.
and I think they're a lot over
and they're is just no styling to them,
you can't tell one Japanese car from the other, because they all a like,
That's true,
that's true.
you know, I don't mean that as a joke,
I mean, they really all look a like,
Yeah.
Yeah.
and the
I don't have any idea what, which car it is, until I look at it to see what it is,
What is what,
yeah.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
and I think they have not, uh, lead the field in styling,
they do have sports cars
Yeah.
but the price is way more,
you can get a Cadillac for, the same price as you can get a small Japanese, car,
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
Yeah,
yeah.
it's ridiculous now.
Yeah.
I know that, uh,
I've, I've sort of always felt like with Buicks it seems like all Buicks to me look alike you know,
Uh-huh.
I guess it just, uh, it seems to me they're all the same shape.
I have a very good friend that has a Buick Regal
and she, she's had, she's got way offer a hundred thousand miles on it
and that's what she's going to buy again
and I'm like, oh, please, it looks exactly the same as this old one that you've got
and, so I guess it's in the eyes of the beholder, I suppose.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah,
well, if, if you're interested you ought to go to the next auto show.
I, I look at the Cadillacs
and boy there were some Cadillacs that I didn't even realize they made
but they were, just styled so differently,
Really.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
they were standard Cadillacs
but they really looked beautiful.
Are they still,
are what they're,
what they have out for like the next year, is everything still pretty square,
it seems like the Cadillacs is one of the few makers that are still making really, I, I can't think of a car that they make are the than maybe the Alliance .
Oh, no,
they have, they have convertibles now in the Cadillac, field
Yeah.
and they have that new, uh,
it's not the big, uh, Fleetwood, the one I want, which is been the same in the last twenty years,
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
there's another one that has came out in the last two year, not the Seville,
the Seville is totally different,
Uh-huh.
now at the auto show they had fantastic looking cars.
Now when, when was this,
was this recently?
Oh, yeah,
it was a month or so ago.
Oh, okay,
because I have,
Well, they have it every year.
Yeah,
usually when I see the new cars it's during the fair when I go to the auto building at the State Fair
and that's usually when I see anything, you know.
Right,
now this was, uh, in it was downtown in the, uh, Convention Center
and, they had all the cars
Oh, I see.
they had Japanese and German cars,
Yeah.
they had the full range ,
and they had some, they had some new cars that weren't even out
they had, uh, a new Chevy Suburban, truck, you know,
Oh, really.
that big, big one that was, uh,
they didn't have a price on it, nor did they know had a it would cost,
Uh-huh.
it had a microwave in it and everything,
Oh, my word.
it was,
they had several futuristic cars.
That's wild, you know,
Yeah.
you hear about things like that
and you think that can't possibly be done,
I mean, it just, that's just too weird.
I know.
And I like engines
they had a lot of broken down not broken down, I mean, you know, cut, uh, displayed engines, you know.
Uh-huh.
Right,
uh-huh,
so you could tell,
see the inside of them or whatever.
Yeah,
Yeah.
but, uh, that, that sold me in buying a new car, you know,
I mean, certainly interested in buying a new car
but again the, yeah, the American cars were for superior in styling and, new engines,
Yeah,
yeah,
well, maybe,
and, uh, I thing so, because they've been making these four cylinder and six cylinder engines for a while * spelling "think"?
somebody's finally woken up, you know.
and, I think that, I, I would definitely buy,
Yeah.
again there's the question are we in the market, uh,
Yeah.
and I could buy anything, you know.
Oh, yeah,
you know, if I could fine, * spelling "find"?
I, I was really crazy about Jags for a while
and the convertible, had a is it X J S or something like that,
and I, you know, thought that's a dream car,
Yeah,
Yeah.
and, and you really would have to be a dream car because the repair bills are supposedly just constant, you know.
Well, I haven't work on them myself so I don't, that, you know, my cars don't go to the shop, you know,
Yeah,
so, uh,
yeah.
I am the kind of engineer
and I've always done it myself
and, uh I've got three of them
Well, that's good that you can.
and, uh, I can't remember one,
I think I had one someone welded a muffler on for me, in a years time,
Oh, really,
that,
oh, gosh,
that's great.
I think that's the only thing of the three vehicles that I've in it just the welding on
like I said I don't do that you know.
I think it takes a talent to do that, you know,
my, my husband is, uh, engineer
but he cannot, I mean,
or maybe he's just doesn't want to mess with it
that's might be part of it,
but, uh, you know, we just, I just say forget it we'll just take it in, and get it taken care it.
Yeah.
He drives, drives a Honda.
I, I, noticed that when I was a kid, uh,
I was wasn't a mechanical engineer
but I worked my way through college as a mechanic
so,
Uh-huh,
I learned early from, fifteen on, and dropped it for a long time when, when after I got out of college and, then picked it up again later on
Right.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
and now again, I've got three vehicles
and I don't, I never get in them and just go to the shop at you will, you know.
Well, that's to, that's one thing that when you would consider,
see when I go out to think about a new car or buy another car, I don't think about, well, is this engine that I can work on or that, you know, my husband can work on or whatever, you know
Uh-huh.
so, you're, you're pretty lucky in that respect that,
Yeah,
I'm keeping V eight, V eight Chevy engines, because that's what I know,
Yeah.
That's when you know,
yeah.
and, in fact, I stock the same part,
I'm like a little stock,
if you, brought your Chevy to me I could, I'd probably have some parts, for it right now, you knows
Uh-huh.
That's pretty good,
it's really been funny because we have like been you are own contractors kind of with this car
and when I say we have redone everything I mean we have done everything,
Oh, that's great,
and it's, it's really been so interesting the people you meet because, uh, my husband Carl has called all over the country, you know,
I've always wanted to that too.
he's gotten these catalogs
it's really more difficult to find these vintage parts when you might think this is for a seventy-three,
Oh, I can imagination,

Laurie?
Yes.
Okay.
I'm supposed to ask you, how do you make use of your credit cards
and I'm supposed to compare those with my, my habits.
Okay.
How do I make use of credit cards?
Yes.
Um, let's see.
I carry a lot of credit cards with me mostly because I don't ever have cash.
Right.
And I I,
do you work for Texas Instruments?
No,
I do not.
Okay.
Well, at T I we have to use what's called a tex teller if we want to get cash out
Uh-huh.
and those are only available at T I.
Oh, okay.
So if I'm in a mall or something I can't get cash out without paying extra money
so I'm always using credit cards.
Sure.
Well, myself I always,
I'm, I'm a traveling person
Uh-huh.
and I'm out of town quite a bit
so I use credit cards quite a lot also as far as everything from service work and gasoline in my car to my lounging, entertainment and for everything.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
me too.
So that's, uh,
as far as using them outside that I'm not, I don't use them too much
but I, I think my wife is sort of like you
she uses a credit card,  most  of the time.
Yeah
So she does most of the shopping for our household
so she'll use them more than I will.
Uh-huh.
But do you get to pay the bills?
Yes.
Same at my house
So it's me I'm always, I'm the guy that always goes to like Dillard's
and I'll go in and charge something
and I'll have to give them my driver's license.
They'll have to look up the number because I'm never carrying a credit card.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
But I do carry like my American Express and my Visa which I use for, you know, primarily work type things.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
This is my first call by the way,
so
Oh, it's mine too.
Oh, is it really?
Yes.
All right
so we're both beginners then.
Yeah.
I've had this for a couple weeks
and I've been out of town
so this is my first time to,  to use it.
Oh, okay.
Okay.
So,
Now, did you pick this topic
or were you given?
No,
I was given this topic.
I see.
Okay.
Yeah,
they give you, they assign you a topic,
you call the eight hundred number,
Right.
Have you tried it yet?
No
Okay.
When you call the eight hundred number, they assign you a topic and, uh, pretty, uh, cut and dried
Huh,
okay.
Um, let's see.
So how long are we supposed to talk for?
I'm not sure.
A couple,
about two three minutes I think.
Okay.
But I really don't have too much more to say in regards to credit cards.
I,
one thing I've always tried to do is when I get my credit cards, I always try to pay them off because I just sort of detest paying interest.
Oh, yes.
And, uh,
Definitely.
like years ago my wife and I got married
Uh-huh.
she was the one with a little bit than I was because I had my credit cards, I think, up to the limit
and I was giving everyone ten dollars a month and everything like that.
Oh.
That will cost you a fortune.
That was like thirty years ago
so now it's a little different.
We,
I get a bill
and I'll pay it the same day it comes
Yes,
yes.
and I just kind of tell my kids how much I hate paying interest
so they should follow the same rule.
That's right.
Well, yeah,
Oh, you bet it's
it's an absolute savings.
Or if you travel for work and you get your reimbursement before the bill comes in,  you get to  keep the money.
You bet.
That's, that's very handy.
Yeah.
It works great.
Well, I think that's all I have.
Okay.
Well, it was nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you
and, uh, give it a try.
I think you'll enjoy it.
Okay.
Okay.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Bye-bye.
Bye.

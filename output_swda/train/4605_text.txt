Hi
Okay.
Do you work with a company that, uh, gives drug testing
Sort of.
I'm a, I'm a student
but, uh, I'm in the National Guard
and they do a little bit of drug testing.
Oh, they do?
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
What, uh,
did they do that before you went in or what?
Uh, they, they do it before you go in
and, occasionally they'll have a, a random urinalysis.
Oh, they will, huh?
Yeah.
So you can't be smoking marijuana in, in the military anymore
Oh.
Okay.
Well, I've,
I worked,
I don't work right now because my company I worked for, P I E, went bankrupt
Oh.
but, uh, they was getting a program set up, that for all new hires they was going drug, uh, give them drug tests.
Oh.
But, uh, they didn't hire very many new hires because all the people that usually work there, you know, just stayed there because it was, they had been there for a long, long time.
Uh-huh.
But, uh, actually, I think they should do it.
Yeah,
I, I believe they should too.
You know, uh, I don't think anybody needs anybody that's, to be working for them that's on drugs of any kind you know.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
definitely.
But, uh, I don't know whether I believe that they should just randomly do it.
I think they should kind of warn them, like, you know, well we're going to do that or maybe tell them before they do get hired, you know  that  this is what is going to happen.
Oh.
And  then if you don't like it, why then, you know, you'll have to go look for a job someplace else.
Uh,
But after you,
you have, to do randomly otherwise people will cheat.
Well, I suppose you are right there too, you know.
Yeah.
Uh,  personally I,
They,
I know  when I was doing my, uh, basic training in A I T there was guys who would fool around
Uh-huh.
and then when that urinalysis came around they would be all scared.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Huh.
The only problem is, you know, if you have done drugs but you've stopped and, uh, you do get caught, it is kind of, kind of harsh.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Well, I suppose they fire you and everything right then, huh?
Or what do they do with you guys if, that you guys get,
Uh, we get counseling
and, uh, I think part of our pay is docked  if we're  first time offenders.
Oh I,  Oh, I see.
I really don't,
I, I haven't,
I don't do any drugs
so I don't know.
Yeah,
well I don't either.
I wouldn't even think about it
I think anybody that does them are dumb,  you know.
Crazy.
Yeah,
yeah.
Yeah
, really.
You're so stupid, God
and you just watch it on T V and see how it just burns your brain completely up, you know.
You don't,
Yeah,
wastes  your future.
Yeah,
really dumb, huh.
Yeah.
But, uh, Let's see, what else was I going to say here.
Uh, what do you think about our, uh, like, uh, other government agencies testing?
Do you think our government agencies should test?
Yeah,
I think so.
I think they all should test really you know.
Yeah.
Uh, it just seems like there is so much more of it going on anymore that, I don't know what's wrong with the people, uh,
Yeah.
but I think that the, the government should do something about stopping it completely.
About it coming into our country.
You know, they just slap somebody's little hand,
and, you know, well, don't do that again
and  and then  you know, they'll get out
Oh, I know,
yeah.
They aren't .
and they're right back at it again.
Yeah.
Right now it is, it's too lucrative for the drug dealers
so the risks are worth it for them.
Yeah.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
Yeah.
But, uh, other than that, why, I don't know.
Like I say, maybe one of these days I'll get a job because I am looking still for a part-time job, you know, since my company went bankrupt
and  I'll see what they do, you know.
Yeah.
But, like I say, I, I wouldn't care because I, I don't, I don't even smoke
so they can test me all I want.
Yeah.
I wonder what if you take medicine if that would effect it.
Oh see, that's,
it is a problem.
Sometimes some medicines will give off a, a false positive.
Yeah,
see  now that  that would be really unfair then, huh?
I've heard  of, I've heard of that,
yeah.
Yeah.
You know.
I believe you should have the testing
but they should be, like, if you get, if you get a positive, they should double check you and still give you the benefit of a doubt.
Yeah.
Find out what, you know, if you have been taking some kind of medication and, you know, if that would effect it and everything.
Uh-huh,
yeah.
But, uh, well I guess that's about all we can talk about.
I think our five minutes is about up anyhow.
Well, it was nice talking to you Rose.
Okay, Lewis,
and maybe I'll talk to you again.
Okay
Alrighty.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye

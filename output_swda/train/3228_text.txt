Okay.
I think the last one that we actually went to go see,
well, there's two.
I took my kids to see A HUNDRED AND ONE DALMATIANS
of course they wanted to see it.
They had the Disney
book and they thought that was wonderful
Uh-huh.
and they loved the dogs,
It's one of my favorite even,
we went with some friends of ours,
and I was a little worried about my son.
He's about two and a half
Uh-huh.
and he's going through a stage right now where he's kind of afraid of dogs barking if he can hear them and can't see them
Yeah,
yeah.
Yeah.
and he did real good through the whole movie except the part where the dogs are sending the message, you know, that the, the, the puppies are missing
Oh, yeah.
and it shows the town,
and you can hear all the barking,
A whole lot,
uh-huh
kind of dark,
uh-huh.
Yeah,
so that kind of bothered him
Good.
but after that he did fine.
Well, how,
is he young?
Yeah,
he'll be three in January.
Yeah,
okay,
that makes sense.
Yeah.
Well, my kids' very favorite, and yours may be too young for it, was HOME ALONE.
I loved that movie.
They, uh,
well we do, too,
but they just want to rent that one.
That is their very favorite.
They think they're so cute.
Probably gives them ideas of what they want to do,
right
I guess so,
I guess so,
I guess so.
We're not real big movie goers ourselves,
but we did try to go see about a month ago that, um, DEAD AGAIN that black and white one,
Yeah.
and I was not real impressed with it.
In fact we kept sitting there all through the theater going now what, what did that mean,
wait, wait run that back,
and we couldn't run it back
Wasn't that good.
uh-huh.
But we, we just kept trying to figure it out until finally toward the end,
and we thought we were being very quiet,
this man turned around and said, Could you all please save that for later.
And I'm sorry
Oh, no.
We're just not real big movie goers.
Well, I like to watch the movies,
but it's gotten so expensive that we wait until they come out on video
Yeah.
Well, that's us too
and we rent them
that's us too.
and now we did go see HOME ALONE at the dollar movie
and that was just hilarious,
I died.
Yeah,
I thought that was cute, too.
And we, we did also,
we went to see WHAT ABOUT BOB one night, which is a funny, funny movie
And my husband's name is Bob
and he wants to see that
it's a funny movie.
yeah,
he wanted to see that.
I thought the funny part in HOME ALONE was, uh, that's good for kids, is kind of coming up with how they can deal with problems on their own without panicking
That's true.
and I thought they could learn a lot of lessons from that.
The little guy is so cute,
and he's terribly rich by now.
I hope he stays cute not spoiled, you know,
Yeah,
me too
you get to where the money goes to their heads or goes to something, you know,
Oh, that's right.
That's right.
they grow up too fast,
so. But, uh, there's a lot I want to see, you know,
what I try to do when they come out is just make a list of them that look good so that when they come out in video.
That's right.
You know, I'd like to see GREEN CARD,
I want to see AWAKENING.
Uh-huh.
AWAKENING, is supposed to be wonderful.
Uh, I'd like to see SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.
Yeah,
AWAKENING is supposed to be wonderful
Yeah.
my mom saw that
and she said that was an excellent movie.
And see, I've had somebody tell me that REGARDING HENRY, you know, the Harrison Ford movie is supposed to be really good,
Yes.
Yes.
I'd like to see that.
I think that's supposed to be good,
and I, uh, we have some doctors at church who said that DOCTOR was just wonderful.
I've heard that's good,
Uh-huh.
yeah.
So I think there's a bunch of good movies coming out.
My kids want to see RESCUER'S DOWN UNDER
Uh-huh.
so I'm going to
my V C R went on the blitz about two weeks ago,
so I'm getting it fixed right now because they have their little movies, their little, you know, Disney movies they watch all the time and stuff
Oh, dear.
Uh-huh.
and,
Well, on, uh,
back to your movie you saw that ten thousand,
uh, HUNDRED AND ONE DALMATIANS
Yeah.
um, did you all ever think about purchasing that one, when it comes out?
You know, I look at those,
like CINDERELLA came out was for sale,
Uh-huh.
and, I don't buy them,
I, now I will copy them and rent them and keep them at home
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
but I just have a problem paying twenty five dollars for a movie that I can go down and rent for a dollar
Well, I understand that, too,
I understand that, too.
Now they had
You know, they don't last that long.
uh-huh,
they had HOME ALONE offered for like,
I think with the rebate you could get it for nine dollars
Oh, that's pretty good,
and I thought well, now that's, that's close enough to being several, you know,
you could rent it more than more than four times and watch that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That, that makes it worth it, uh,
but, a lot of the Disney movies, it's just too expensive,
and I can rent them
Well, I I understand I understand,
or I can make a copy you know,
my daughter's in love with the LITTLE MERMAID
Oh, yeah,
of course.
and I have a copy that's just about worn out.
Uh-huh.
She's four
Yeah.
so she just thinks the
in fact she told me, Mom if we have a little girl and she has red hair we're naming her Aerial.
Oh, sweet
Now, I'm not pregnant, mind you,
but this is,
But that's,  in her plans.
she's planning ahead,
Yeah,
Well, it's hard, it's hard to find a movie any more these days that you can take your kids
Yeah.
and even the ones that we rent at home, the trouble with some of them I know,
we rented ADVENTURES IN BABY-SITTING thinking that would be so cute,
Oh, I know.
and it's a precious movie,
but the language in it is just for no reason, has to stick in,
Now, see, I remember thinking it's a wonderful movie,
but it's been so long since I watched it,
Uh-huh.
I don't remember the language.
Well, you watch,  it differently  when your kids are in the room, you know
Was it bad?
Well, that's true.
and I was just sitting there going, Oh, my goodness,
and I'm going to have to stop and explain,
and they go, I know, Mommy, I know.
Oh, and see my kids weren't in the
you're right,
I watched it without them.
Uh-huh,
yeah,
it's, it's a little different, because you see things from a different different angle.
Huh.
Huh.
Uh, we rented,
this summer before we went on vacation,
we rented Chevy Chase and that FAMILY VACATION.
Yes.
And those are just absolutely hilarious
Yes.
but you just really can't watch a lot of that.
We had to fast forward through a whole lot of it for them to see it
Yes
Some of it just isn't,

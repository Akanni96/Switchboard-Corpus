Hello.
Yes,
I forgot we had to hit one
Our time will be up.
Well, I hit one and nothing happened.
What's going on?
Well, just go ahead and talk,
that's all.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Don't they usually tell you to say something?
I don't think so.
Oh.
Uh-huh.
Okay,
we're supposed to talk about lawn and garden.
Yes,
I'm, I'm supposed to find out what you do for your lawn and garden.
What do I do?
Uh-huh.
Well, I, uh, I cut it occasionally.
Good.
Uh-huh,
you're ahead of me.
Is, uh, is that good?
Okay.
That's better.
And I edge it occasionally.
Oh, that's really good.
Yeah,
see, am I good, or what?
Yeah.
And, uh, Uh, much beyond that I don't do
I don't do any of that.
Really,
well, I call my lawn man, Eric, whatever his name is, I can't remember. Who's going to come and build me a fence, too.
Uh-huh.
Oh, he is going to build you a fence.
Well, he's giving me an estimate.
Uh-huh.
And for ten dollars a week, I don't see any reason for me to be doing it.
What, for a fence?
Oh, well, I thought, isn't he the same one?
he is.
Yeah.
Yeah,
but ten dollars, or what what does he charge, not even that.
What does he charge me?
Well, my,
I don't know.
It's like next to nothing.
it's ten because I,
it's forty a month.
Yeah.
But if there's five weeks, I still pay forty.
Yeah,
but you know, you ought to get him to pull the weeds.
Well, he won't pull weeds.
He says he'll spray them,
but he won't pull them.
Oh.
Uh, he won't cut them is what he won't do. Because he said with the rocks that it's too dangerous for him to take the, the trimmer over the rocks
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
and he's right.
Yeah.
That's true.
But he just says to keep spraying them so,
Well so,
Anyway, Gene sprayed them once or twice for me
so that was real,
Yeah,
so you haven't, you haven't pulled any weeds lately?
No.
No.
There are two out front
I thought I'd grab one of these days,
but I haven't bothered as I walk on by.
Yeah.
I started to pull the weeds in the rocks out front
Uh-huh.
and all of a sudden I came cross this big clump of weeds
and there was dog dirt in it
Oh, oh, goody.
and I threw the gloves in the trash bag that was out there
and I left the whole thing
and  that was about a month ago.
I thought you were going to say there  I thought you were going to say there was a snake in the weeds
I would rather a snake,
no
Oh, God, oh
I just left the whole thing.
The bag is still out there because I haven't touched it.
Yeah.
I haven't gone back over there.
It really made me mad.
Oh, God.
So anyway but,
But, uh, how are your, your flowers, your little things you planted?
Did they die or what?
Oh, yeah,
now they died.
Oh, they're all,
so they, oh,
are they going to come back in the spring?
I don't know.
Oh.
I don't know,
and then I got some nice, uh, mums at Thanksgiving that I put in the pots out there
Uh-huh.
and I thought they were supposed to live through all the cold weather.
Yeah.
They looked real pretty until about a week before Christmas,
then they started to die, too.
Oh.
So, I don't think any of it comes back
but I don't know,
Yeah.
maybe these,
sometimes things do that aren't even supposed to.
I don't know, uh,
So,
Those flowers, remember those little ones you gave me?
Yeah.
Yeah,
well, they're, I know they were still blooming up until about a, a few weeks ago.
Really?
Yeah.
Well, that's good.
They're the best kind.
Yeah
they, They're really pretty.
They, they're like indestructible.
They really grow nice
and sometimes, they're not supposed to come back,
but lots of times they do.
Uh-huh.
So,
Yeah
We'll see.
They're letting us have a lot of time on this aren't they?
Yeah,
I mean isn't it supposed to be five minutes?
But that's because we didn't hit one for a long time.
We didn't disconnect, did we
I hope not
Neither one of us is getting paid for this.
Boy, I hate to think I hate to think I'd be talking to you without getting paid
Yeah,
really,
I know it.
I can't believe this.
I got somebody from Utah and somebody,
What?
Uh-huh.
where was the person last night was from far away.
You're kidding?
Really?
And we get each other down the street.
This is so funny.
Well, the, uh,
I, I talked to someone woman from Oklahoma City and some woman from Dallas
and that was it.
Yeah,
I've had Dallas, Arlington.
I've had, uh, one Plano and then a lady from Brigham, Utah whose  son  lives in Plano on Ranier someplace. And then, uh, another state,
Uh-huh.
Wow.
Really?
I can't remember,
but she told me about the Utah Jazz,
we talked about basketball.
Oh, really
And I don't remember what, what the place was last night,
but I'm thinking Colorado,
Yeah.
but I'm not sure
I'd know the place, anyway.
Uh-huh.
So,
I don't know,
But mostly they're from the area.
Yeah.
It,
Well, there isn't really much to talk about as far as lawn and garden goes.
Not for me.
Not for me either.
You know, not not for me because all I have is rocks and weeds.
What do I,
Yeah,
but I don't, you know,
I, what do I do, cut it one, you know, and, and edge it
and that's about it.
I know.
What do I do with it?
I know,
we're not typical Texans.
No.
What's going on,
are they going to tell us to stop or what
I don't know,
I hope so.
Come on,
come on.
Isn't it five minutes?
I don't know.
I, I mean, I'm all talked out about gardens.
I know.
Well, we can talk about something else.
It's just a suggested topic.
Oh, oh, it's just suggested?
So, how's the baby, do you think
What?
How's the,
We could talk, Let's talk about the baby.
Let's talk about the baby.

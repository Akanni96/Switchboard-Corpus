Okay, uh, I guess, we are just supposed to talk about things we do in our spare time.
Uh-huh.
Uh, I basically read books.
Uh-huh.
It is,
I do.
Sometimes, when everybody's gone to bed, my kids are in bed and my husband in bed,
so I will just stay up and finish a book that I am,
I have about three books that I am going on.
And I will work on one for a little bit, you know, and then the next one.
But that's just kind of,
Well, that is pretty impressive to have three books going.
Not always,
just sometimes.
Oh, yeah.
And what what kind of books do you read?
Uh, just really different ones.
Uh, I have one that I was reading on, uh, raising your children and then another one on a, an autobiography, and another one on, uh, uh, uh, like a crime story
Oh yeah
A true crime story.
Oh, do you like those detective stories?
Yeah.
But this,
it was a true one.
It was just a little different though.
Reading that one last night.
Oh, well that is interesting.
Actually, I like to read also,
but, uh, usually fall into one or two categories, either true science fiction or fantasy on the one hand or highly technical.
Yeah,
like my husband.
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah,
kind of one or the other.
You must, uh, work for T I?
Yes.
Yeah,
my husband does too.
Yeah,
and I am a computer scientist.
Yeah.
But, I have a lot of other hobbies.
Uh-huh,
really.
Well, yeah,
I am kind of, uh, I guess what you would call it, a project person.
Oh, really.
Yeah,
and I love,
like I have a shop
and when things break around the house, I always try to fix them myself
and so, hobby,
it's, it's funny, uh,
from the one stand point, it is work.
But it is a hobby too, that I enjoy to do.
Yeah.
To find broken,
Yeah,
yeah.
What kinds of things do you fix?
Well, essentially anything you find in a house. Uh, a stove, or oven or a broken piece of porcelain or, uh, chipped tile on the floor. I mean just anything.
Oh.
And you have a shop?
Well it, it is not anything elaborate.
It is just a work bench and a gazillion tools.
Yeah.
But, enough that, again for anything in the house I could  probably,
Yeah,
you can fix just about everything and anything.
Right.
Well, that is great.
And in the car,
I guess the car too.
Yeah.
And so, uh, I think I probably would consider that a hobby.
Although, sometimes it gets to be excessive.
Yeah.
That is pretty much like my husband.
He is, he is pretty, uh, mobile in that area too.
He, he works on the cars.
He rarely takes them in
Yeah
I,
and, uh, he works on irons, and all T V and stuff too.
We rarely have to take those things in too.
Right.
Yeah,
I think it, it,
not only can it be fun,
but it can certainly help your finances.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah,
definitely.
So, do you have any art, uh, how do I say it, creative or artistic  hobbies?
Uh.  Not really.
I mean during Christmas I work on, you know, like, uh, holiday sweat shirts and those kinds of things.
Oh yeah,
well that's good.
But, but, uh, not really
Yeah.
Well, I don't necessarily either.
I can plink out a song or two on a piano
Oh.
and I can, uh,
I don't necessarily draw or do any of that kind of art,
I guess uh, graphic arts is that what they call it,
Yeah.
Yeah.
I can't do any of that,
but sweat shirts is certainly impressive.
Uh-huh.
Uh, I belong to this organization for, uh, if, if you have preschool children
Uh-huh.
and, uh, every once and a while they will have a craft, uh, section for the moms
Oh, yeah.
and those are really neat
and we learn to do the, uh, transfer pictures on the sweatshirts transfer photos
Oh, yeah.
Uh-huh.
and, uh, those are really neat.
So we learn different crafts like that uh
I see.
Well, that is neat
Yeah.
I guess you could consider that a hobby.
Do you, do you cook for a hobby
or do you,
No
I cook dinner
That's not something you,
I don't consider it a hobby
I understand that.
But, uh, you know, I
no
I am not a real elaborate cook or anything like that unfortunately.
Yeah.
I like to bake off and on.
And usually once a week I will bake something,
but it's not anything elaborate, you know
Right.
At least, I don't think it is.
Yeah.
So,
But, I think that still borders on hobby.
Yeah.
Probably the other thing I do which I am sure will sound horrible to you, but is I program for fun. Uh, on the computer.
Uh-huh.
So, I have little projects little computer projects going on that I consider hobbies.
Uh-huh.
But, drive my wife crazy.
Oh.
Well good.
You have a computer at home?
I do,
yes.
Oh, good.
Yeah.
In fact, there is actually several of them here right now.
Oh,  really.
Not all of them  being mine.
Wow.
Then you are busy
Yeah.
Uh-huh,
that is very good.
Uh, I wonder if you can construe raising children as being a hobby?
Well, you know one of the books that I did, that I was reading,
and I stopped because it was so,
it's
the book is so detailed
Uh-huh.
and you have to,
sometimes I have to go back and read the page over again cause I didn't quite get it all.
And, uh, it is so detailed,

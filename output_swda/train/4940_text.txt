Okay
Okay Carol.
So, air quality.
Yeah.
Is it, like water running and she is doing
I know in here, uh, downtown Dallas, it's, you, I mean you drive by and you can just, you can see it.
Uh-huh.
But, then again I originally was from California
and, uh, there is a big difference between Texas and California.
And, uh  they'd have their smog alerts and where you'd have to stay indoors for so many hours with an air conditioner.
Surely.
And, of course, they don't have that here in Texas
so, there's ...
You mean they don't have the, uh, the smog alerts?
No,
not in, not in well not in Dallas, that is.
Right.
I, I, yeah, I spent a summer in Tyler so I know, just east of Dallas there.
Yeah.
We're going there tomorrow.
Oh, really
Uh-huh
We're  packing and getting ready to go  to  .
Yeah.
Actually,  I'm a California born person.
Uh-huh.
I was born in L A
so I know what you're talking about.
In L A, it's pretty bad.
Yeah.
Oh, okay.
Yeah,
you do then.
Uh, the worst city in the, in the world is actually, uh, Mexico City.
Is it really?
Yes.
I would not imagine that.
The worst one for smog is Mexico City.
Huh.
The most polluted city in the world
Huh.
You learn  something every day.
.
Yeah.
I know that they've, they're looking at, uh, uh, you know, uh, you know, better running automobiles.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
I've seen that.
Uh, some things they do, one of them is they're using corn in fuel.
Huh.
You ever heard of that?
Huh-uh.
Yeah.
Methanol?
Huh.
No
Yeah.
Well that's big up here because of the, they grow a lot of corn
Oh, yeah
Yeah.
Uh, that's one thing that they do.
At that, it's pretty easy to do.
Uh-huh.
And the, uh,
unfortunately, it still contributes to global warming cause, you have to, you know, wipe out forests to grow corn and  things like that.
Yeah,
that's true.
It doesn't make sense.
Uh, but it's, you know,
one of the most, uh, productive crop in the  world  is corn.
Right.
Huh.
And, of course, I doubt if there's any,
you can buy regular anymore.
You buy unleaded.
Right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Huh.
Drive cars with catalytic converters, and all that.
It's interesting.
They're, they're looking at,
there's some work being done on, uh, automobiles that are electrical powered
Uh-huh.
And, uh, they're looking at where you have a battery operated car basically,
but it has a, a engine in the back that charges it.
Uh-huh.
So the engine kicks on when the batteries need power
and it turns off.
Uh-huh.
Interesting thing about gas is when, I mean, about battery powered cars is when you're at a stop light, you're not using any any energy
Huh
That is good.
Unlike  a car where it's running.
Yeah.
A electric car it's on demand.
I mean it's either on or off.
Yeah.
Basically.
Huh.
You don't have to shift
So you,
cars become very simple  all  of a sudden too.
Oh.
Very interesting.
That would be nice.
I think I saw that on T V one time.
They,
maybe it was C N N where they were demonstrating that. Or something similar to that.
Yeah.
There's, there's a race in Australia with solar powered cars.
Huh.
And Ford and  General Motors and all those compete.
But what,
I think that was a, a, a setback.
That they,
I don't know,
they went, I don't know, how many miles an hour.
I think like
Right.
Yeah
I don't know. Huh. * See note above
G M, uh, Chrysler announced that they're going to, they're,
well they actually have an electric minivan.
Yeah.
Their, their Caravan.
But it costs, uh, fifty thousand dollars  right now.
Yeah,
and they're, they're very expensive too.  .
To operate, yeah.
But, you know, people are buying them.
You know whose buying them? *"whose" = who's"
The power company.
Free, you know, free for them.
Well, yeah.
Yeah.
Kind of interesting  so see.
Well, it  doesn't make sense.
Because if they want people to convert, you know. They should make it worthwhile.
Uh-huh.
Yeah
It's top speed is something like eighty miles an hour.
So it's  a good,  good  vehicle.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um. Well I'll tell you. Sometimes it's, it's pretty bad here.
Like today I think it was pretty bad.
I don't know if it was, if it's just, uh, the allergies or what
but some days it's very nice here downtown
Uh-huh
and other days it's just really bad,
so, I don't know.
So what, what kinds of things did you experience in L A when you were there?
Or can you remember?
Were you there at a?
Oh, I wasn't there too long ago. Uh.
Cause I haven't been there probably ...
Well, you know, going over the hills, you know, coming into the valley?
Yeah.
You can see that horrible, horrible brown haze.
Well, we were there when they had a

Okay,
basically I can tell you that I like just about every music there is except for, uh, uh, real hard, hard rock,
I really can't get into that
but I go from classical all the way to, uh, jazz and country and uh, soft pop, uh,
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
so I pretty much have a, a wide range of, uh, what I like,
and just, there isn't any particular music that I enjoy more than just listening to all kinds
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
so that's about it.
I can even take the
now, it's, it's pretty neat music that they came out with,
so.
I'm pretty much the same way,
but there's like certain types of country western I can't handle that twangy stuff,
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh,
sure,
the old, old stuff that came out, I think it was, was it, oh, jeez, came out with some of that, Hank Williams,
you talk about twangy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
My in-laws listen to the kind of music I hate
Oh, yeah,
the old, old country,
Yeah.
But other than that, I like pretty much everything.
Yeah,
yeah,
that's the way I am, too,
so, other than, uh,
as far as instruments, I can go from piano to the saxophone.
Lately, you know, with the new music that has come out, some of the really good, uh, music they have the saxophone playing,
Uh-huh.
and it's so funny, because you can take an instrument and forget what it really sounds like when it plays by itself.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
to Oops, are you okay, Tiana, come here honey.
talking to Oh, my daughter just fell.
Do you like Kenny G?
Uh, yeah,
a little bit.
Uh-huh.
I can, I can pretty much, to
Oh, it's all wet, Tiana.
talking to I just wiped, uh, did the floor,
and she slipped.
On,
no.
Anyway, but, uh, um, yeah,
I can take all kinds of music pretty much except for when you get, like I said, into the real hard rock,
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
the heavy metal,
Yeah,
I have no interest in that,
I, I don't have interest of losing my ears,
let's just put it that way, hearing, anyway,
Yeah,
I saw Peter Townsend on T V last night,
and he said he's lost most of his hearing
Uh-huh,
sure.
and I thought, no wonder
so.
Uh-huh,
exactly.
Um.
Okay,
well it was good talking to you then.
Well, same here.
Okay.
You all have a good day.
You, too.
Bye-bye.
Bye now.

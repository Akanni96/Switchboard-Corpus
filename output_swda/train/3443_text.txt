Surprised they get anybody this time of day
but, I've been trying all different times,
Uh-huh.
but I don't get  anybody at five thirty, don't get anybody at nine at night
so thought,  I'll try ,
Oh, well, I'm at,  work
and I just happened to walk back into my office.
Oh
I've been  gone for a little while
Oh.
Well, I go to school
so I'm home certain days,
Uh-huh.
and, uh,  I really haven't been making any phone calls, have you?
Got,
I don't, I haven't ever made any.
I just receive them
Oh
Have you, have you received many?
I haven't here lately.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's, it's, uh,
well, the first time we were on this it came just about every day.
Yeah.
I never  had to make one.
They just always came
Yeah.
Exactly.
People must be tired of it or something.
well anyway I guess we're supposed to discuss this, uh, subject,
what do you think?
Well, I never gave it any thought myself
I was hoping you could tell me what you thought.
Oh.
Well, I don't have any objection to people doing that.
I think it might be good for them.
Uh-huh.
But  as a mother of two daughters I might be afraid of where they were sent.
Exactly.
I'm  just concerned about their safety
Uh-huh.
because  if they do good work in America they'll probably be sent to a ghetto
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
And if they were  sent to a third world country I couldn't help but wait worried, you know.
Yeah,
yeah.
That,  that would be my main objection. I don't think,
Uh-huh.
I don't know
I think maybe it's, it should stay on a voluntary basis
it will probably never happen
but,
Yeah.
Yeah,
I, I think it would be good for, uh, everyone to do something like that
but I, I guess I don't feel like it should be something forced upon you.
Yeah,
well it, it probably won't.
Uh-huh.
I don't,  I don't even know how we'd pay for it anyway.
We can't, uh seem to pay for all the little things we have going now
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
That's another consideration
Exactly
But, uh, I don't know
some kids are so spoiled nowadays
it might be a real eye opener, you know
Really
I mean, sometimes my kids are on the other side of town here
and they just see some really tiny modest wood frame homes
and then they think,
they're just kind of shocked at that side of town, you know
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
I probably lived in one of those when I was a little girl
I have a girlfriend that every time her son starts taking things for granted she threatens to send him to Mexico with her relatives and let him get a taste of that  for a while
Oh
Well that would be an eye opener, wouldn't it?
Wouldn't it though?
I mean right next to us is such a pitiful country.
Uh-huh,
it is.
I know.
Sometimes I wish we'd help them out instead of going all across the world,  and  helping some countries I never even heard of.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
I know it.
It seems to me we are,
it would be to our benefit to strengthen that country. Right on our borders.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
But, what do I know, right?
I'm just sitting at home and, and, uh, doing laundry today and certainly not up,
nobody has called me from Washington
Oh, but, uh, anyway, how did you get on this program?
I work at T I.
Oh, you do work at T I?
Oh, you're in Lewisville.
Uh-huh.
Oh, yeah.
I just went by that place.
We were going to a football playoff game a week or so ago which we lost
and, uh we went by.
That's the first time I'd seen it.
It looked really nice.
Yeah.
A lot of trees there.
It looked like a pretty little, a sight.
Hang on a minute.
Sure.
to someone in the No,
I don't think so,
Yeah,
Patty might.
I'm back.
Oh, sure.

But  how did you get on it?
Well, my husband works at T I over on Central.
Oh.
Uh, why we're living in Arlington I'm not so sure
but, he works over there
and
we did it last time.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, so I'm, just my daughter and I are registered this time.
I don't know,
they didn't even ask him back
Really?
That was weird, wasn't it?
Huh.
But like I said I hardly ever get any calls this time.
Uh-huh.
I don't get too many.
And I can never find  anybody.
Huh.
So, um,
The first time I used to get calls from far away too.
Right.
Like Maryland,  and  New Jersey,
Uh-huh.
and but now it just seems like it's in the Dallas Fort Worth area that I get calls from.
Yeah,
I've had the same experiences,
Uh-huh.
all  right around here.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
I don't know, uh,
I wonder if they really,
I don't know if they could possibly teach a machine to recognize all the different accents.
There's just, there's so many with this one town you know.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
even in some families some people talk a little bit different.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
My husband is  from New Jersey
and one of his sisters does things that really sound funny to me
and he doesn't pronounce them at all that way,
and that's one family, right?
Of course, I think everybody in New Jersey sounds a little bit funny
but
Oh, I agree.
You know, how that goes
Oh, shoot.
Oh, God.
Well, I'm surprised she hasn't told us to cut it off yet.
Sometimes she says at night. Or, or or overloads
Yeah.
so please end your conversation.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
Right.
Well, do you have any more words of wisdom about the subject?
No,
I sure don't
You don't have any kids you want to send over here?
No,
no kids
Well, is
Oh, shoot.
Well, uh,  I don't know if mine would want to go live in the ghetto.
Well, one of them is real idealistic,
she might
My sister is,
I'd be more suited to that than her
she's just bugs,

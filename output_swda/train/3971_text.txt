All right.
Okay,
so what do you think of the Giants?
Uh, I like the Giants.
They got, uh,
I probably didn't get into baseball until maybe, maybe three years ago really
Yeah.
so, uh, but I, I just like the Giants.
I don't, I don't know why.
I really got into them.
I read, uh, Dave Dreveki's book his autobiography
Oh, yeah.
Yeah
and,
wasn't that something of him.
Yeah,
that, that was incredible.
Yeah,
that's really a,
really proud of him though, the way he's, you know.
The way he handled that  entire situation, there.
Yeah,
really,  you know.
But, I just think the Giants have a good team.
They, they got all, you know,
they're, they're, they're real balanced out.
They got real good pitching,
and they got the hitting to go along with it.
So.
Yeah,
I just don't understand why they're not right up there on the top you know.
Yeah,
they just they need that, I think they just need that one, one element to push them over the top, you know.
I don't really know what it is,
but, but every team that's, that's really good seems,
you know, like the A had, they had, they just had it all that one year.
So.
Yeah,
um I was mostly an A fan, you know.
I had been to more games at the A than I have in the Giants because, uh, I lived in Oakland you know, for some time.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But, uh, I still like the Giants, though, you know
Yeah,
if you're a fan you got to stay with the team any way,  you know, you  good and the bad
Yeah,
right.
but. It's, it's kind of hard.
I still, basically, the, the,
me and all my friends around here, since we don't have anywhere,
I mean, we can go to the Astros or the Rangers teams,
but since,
me, none of me and my friends are really, really like either one of those teams,
so  we, uh
Uh-huh.
about, about the most baseball we get is either T V or we play it on Nintendo.
We play R B I baseball on Nintendo
so. So that's just, you know, that's small town trying to make it through the not being around it really,
Yeah,
right,
right.
Yeah.
but.
Yeah,
right.
Well, I prefer uh, football over baseball,
Yeah.
Yeah,
so do I,
but baseball is still
it's.
you got, you got to do something when football ain't on.
So
So, hot dogs, baseball and apple pie. Huh.
Yeah,
exactly.
This is America,
so.
Yeah,
um.
But.
So what do you think is going to happen this year to the teams?
Uh, I don't know, it's hard to say.
I haven't really, really,
you have to just keep up with everything in the season.
It's kind of hard to do,
at least,  you know,  you have to read the paper and SPORTS ILLUSTRATED and everything to keep up with who they traded and who they picked up and, and all that,
I know.
but, like I say, if they can, if they can get that one element that they were missing, I think the Giants can do it.
Yeah,
well, the Giants are.
They just,
I don't,
yeah
I don't really know about the A
They kind of.
Yeah,
makes you sick, doesn't it?
Yeah.
You hear what, you hear what, you hear what he did.
Yes.
He ramming his wife's car,
and I was like, yeah.
He's like a little bitty kid, huh.
Yeah,
he's just a, a, a little boy with a lot of money.
So.
Yeah
That's just,
you know, but.
Yeah,
well, I guess the Giants or, might move away from San Francisco, it sounds like.
Yeah,
I've heard, I've heard talk about that.
You know, uh, they won't be that far away,
but San Francisco will be hurting, anyhow.
Yeah,
they're not going to be happy about it.
You know.
But I hope they can do good.
I mean, that's just,
I think they're a good team. That just need that one, one little thing to push them over.
I don't know exactly what it is.
They got,
they're pretty balanced out all the way through.
It just might be the drive, you know more than anything else,
Uh-huh.
they just, they probably just need something to push them because I, that's, that's the only thing I can see that's holding them back, is the ambition to do it.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
Or somebody basically,
maybe they just need everybody to tell them they can't do it.
Maybe that's what, you know, that's what some teams need.
Look at the Twins going from worst to first.
I know, isn't that something
Yeah,
my roommate my roommate's a Twins fan, for forever,
I couldn't believe that, huh.
so, he had his year this year,
so.
Yeah,
I just, it.
We got we, we got into that a whole bunch.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
That was a, that was a series to remember, for sure.
Uh-huh.
So I saw all seven games of that,
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
yeah,
I couldn't believe that, you know.
Yeah.
I don't, uh,
there was Braves in that chanting that they had.
That would drive you up a wall.
Yeah
they,
every team with the Indians been doing that now.
You know.
I can't figure out why.
You have to figure out why they're all doing that, I'm like, it's doesn't work, it's obvious it doesn't work because the, you know the Braves, Braves didn't win,
Yeah,
well, you're right
so, uh, why keep on doing something that didn't work,
but I don't know.
Yeah,
yeah.
Yeah.
I was, I was kind of surprised that we were going to talk about baseball,
and I get a woman's voice.
I was, I was, I was thinking, uh-huh,
I talked to a guy named Vinny last night about fixing your car,
so.
Oh, really?
Yeah,
I got, I called, got a call the other night about, uh, fixing your automobile up,
so.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
Well, baseball's baseball.
Yeah,
right.
It's kind of,
I don't know, it's kind of odd they pick,
do you pick the topic or does the computer?
No,
uh, they give you a list of things that you want,

Okay,
go ahead.
Well, I, I, uh, we're going to compare notes. Uh,
Yeah.
I, uh, I  often desire  to exercise, often believe I should and rarely do.
Don't do it
Well, I tell you, I, I firmly believe in exercising.
I think it's a,
I do it every day on a regular basis.
I,
What, what, what sort of, of regiment do you have?
Well, I just got back from biking twelve and a half miles,
but this time of year, you can't get much biking in. Uh,
but every morning I use this President's, uh, council of physical fitness
and it really is, uh, uh, it's worth doing,
and you can do it anywhere.
I, I travel quite a bit in my in my business,
Yes.
and you can do it, you know, wherever you're at
and if you do it,
I, I do it every morning after, uh, usually after breakfast before I take a shower and get, you know, dressed going you know, to go to work.
Yes.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, now what I do,
I mean, I've done this for, you know, like fifteen years,
so you don't start at this kind of regiment, you know.
Yes.
I,
so, what I'm telling you isn't something you go out and do
and, and you'll hurt yourself Uh,
every, every, uh,
it takes me about fifteen minutes to do this now because I do it all the time,
but I, uh, I do twenty-five, uh, uh, where you have your arms above your head and and your body twisters touch right, you know, left and right toe
Uh-huh.
and I do, uh, ten, uh, right and left, uh, trunk twisters.
Uh-huh.
And I do, uh, about sixty, uh, bicycle, type, uh, leg thrust type things.
Uh-huh.
And I do, uh, twenty, uh, leg lifters on each side. You know when you're laying on the floor.
Yes.
Yes.
Right.
And then I do fifty push-ups and do a hundred sit ups
and, uh, then I do about, uh,
My goodness,
you do all of this in fifteen minutes?
Oh, yeah,
oh, yeah.
And then, uh, thirty, uh,
now if you did football, like the old grass drills where you're on your stomach and you
Uh-huh.
you know, prone type things, where you're kind of rocking on your stomach type thing,
and that takes about, really about, maybe about thirteen minutes, uh in the morning.
Yeah.
Now what, what keeps you doing that.
I mean, I, I sometimes start little, much less, much more modest efforts,
but I give up,
I just find them boring.
Hard to find the time for it on a given day
Well, uh,
and,
Years ago I used to, uh, referee football
Yes.
and, uh, to stay in condition, I did that, uh, just as a normal  basis,
Yes.
and, uh, uh, I tell you just by doing it, uh,
well, example, this summer I, I was about fifteen pounds heavier than I wanted to be
so I, I increased,
I do three hundred sit ups a day now, but not at that, in the morning,
I do a hundred then
and then I do about a hundred before supper and about a hundred before I go to bed.
Uh-huh.
I lost fifteen pounds just by doing that because you tighten your stomach muscles
Yes.
and, you know, you can eat anything you want, drink anything you want,
but you don't, you know,
within reason, you know, you can lose weight or maintain your weight and your physical being
Uh-huh.
Yep.
and, uh, I just, you know,
you're ready to go at a,
I, I, I think it's really important.
Well, I, I, whenever I do it, I feel good. I mean good that I have done, good because it's, it seems right and good because it has good effects.
Good.
But, but it's this maintaining a, a regular habit that I just can't seem to do.
Well, that's why Chuck, I think, uh, if you did it on a daily basis and you didn't need elaborate things, you know, where you can make excuses like,
Yeah.
well, I, I like biking
and during the summer, I'll do, you know, at least seventy-five miles a week and when I really was doing it maybe a hundred and fifty,
Uh-huh.
but you can't, you know,
Uh-huh.
there's excuses, weather
Yep.
or you don't have time or something like that.
But if you do some basic exercises and you say every morning, just like brushing your teeth you're going to spend fifteen minutes or a half hour. And you get up a half hour earlier
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
and once you start getting into that, one, you just feel good
Yes.
and you look a whole lot better.
Yes.
Do you, do you does your wife participate in any of this
or,
Unfortunately not,
and there's no way I can get her to.
Uh-huh.
It's a, like it's something you either just really want to do it
or you can't talk anyone into it.
If you don't like to exercise, you know, it isn't going to happen.
Yes,
yes.
I, I sure wish she would.
She's, you know, unfortunately overweight,
and, but she's a wonderful woman
and you know, no sense getting in arguments with anybody, about it.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
yeah.
Well I, I, uh, I keep saying if somebody else would do it with me, I, that would be, little bit of peer pressure would help considerably.
Well,
But you seemed to have solved that problem without any, any external help.
No problem at all.
And, uh, if you get one of these mats. You know, go to a store, they normally have these exercise, things, these A B C of physical fitness on them.
Yeah.
One of my kids got me one of those for Christmas one year
and, uh,
What, what, what, what's on, what's this mat, I mean,
It, it, it's just an exercise mat that rolls up
so you can put it up, you know, just in the corner.
Is it like the sort of thing you take on a camping trip  and sleep on it.
Well, yeah,
you can do that.
I mean, it's that, it's that kind of like  half inch of foam or something.
But, but it doesn't,
Yeah,
it's a foam thing,
yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah,
and it's, it's just about six feet long, rolls up
Yeah.
and I don't take it on trips with me.
I, you could,
but, uh, I don't mind, uh, you know,
if I do like sit ups, I'll throw a, a towel down or something. You know,
Yeah.
so you don't have the abrasive,

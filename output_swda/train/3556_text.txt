Okay,
Jerry, the topic was favorite T V shows, and what kind are you interested in, and how they, and do they differ from like mine.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Well, okay, uh,
most of, most of the, uh, commercial television these days, I'm just a little bit sick of.
Uh, in fact, I don't watch hardly any, uh, television at all with, uh, my other activities.
Uh, between my family and my church et cetera, et cetera, well I don't have time, I hardly any time to sit down and watch the news.
Right.
Now I do watch the Discover channel and some on channel thirteen
but, uh, aside from aside from that, I pretty well, uh, turn it off.
Oh, do you,
yeah.
Oh, I'm sort of a, well,
I'm different from that.
I'm sort of a, a movie buff.
Uh-huh.
I go to a couple of movies a week, sometimes,
but honestly I'm, I'm self-employed,
and a lot of times I will, uh, go out and take a lunch hour, go to lunch from like twelve to two, go to a movie and just come back to my office.
I don't blame you.
But, uh, I do it,
it's like entertainment,
and I'm pretty much of a, a junk movie watcher by myself.
Uh-huh.
If I take my wife, then we see something a little nicer, you know.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
But, uh,
and my kids are all sort of movie watchers.
You know, we, we've always been to a lot of, we've always gone to a lot of movies in our life.
So, but I would just as soon, uh, be doing something else,
it's just that my kids are gone now,
and, and my wife's a school teacher
and sometimes, and she doesn't get home until about seven o'clock.
So, you know, I'll come in like five thirty or six,
and I'll turn on the tube set there and have my coffee or Coke or whatever and a little T V
Uh-huh.
and sometimes I set there all evening.
Yeah
I, well, it,
sometimes if, if it's real good,
like there's more, there's been more than one evening that I've, uh, caught, uh, every animal show that evening on, uh, on the Discover channel.
You bet,
you bet.
And, uh, because they're, uh, they're, they're, you know, they're documentaries and they're.
Well, that's an interesting channel.
Oh, you bet,
in fact I'm glad that it's part of our, uh, basic cable package.
That's great.
But, uh,
You know, I've, I've just never spent any time watching it
and, you know I like my sports and everything
Uh-huh.
but I,
Oh, oh, me too.
Hello
Watch my Dallas Cowboys.
I watched them to halftime before I left
and I left at halftime
Well, they, they, they whooped up on them.
and started driving.
They sure did.
They just did an excellent job.
Uh-huh,
and they're in the playoffs,
and I'm not sure that the Eagles are not.
Yeah,
the Eagles
I did.
yeah
luck into it now, I think.
Yeah,
that's true.
Cowboys, they earned it on their own merit.
Well.
Did you know, everybody, or not everybody but quite a few of the folks were kind of down on Mister Johnson,
but, uh, he's, uh, he's brought the pokes, uh, from a, a one and something team to, uh, playoffs, in what, three years now.
You bet,
as much as everyone, you know, used the word, love Tom Landry, I'm glad that Jimmy Johnson's there.
Uh-huh,
well, it's, uh, you know, it was the time for the passing of the guard, I mean.
It was.
And I think Tom knew it.
I think so too.
So, uh,
He wanted to go out a winner though.
I think he would have stayed there four or five more years until he could have gone out
Yeah,
that's true,
and I wouldn't, I wouldn't have blamed him one bit because
Oh, no,
it's, you know he earned his stripes.
yeah,
but, see, nobody remembers him as a loser because he's too, he's too far, he's far too much of a gentleman and a, and a practicing Christian to, uh to ever be thought of as anything but a you know, but a winner.
I know.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah,
he's a, he's a winner in anyone's book
Yeah.
and I hope he's a winner in his own book, you know because that's the key there.
Oh, he is,
he is
because he has to like himself before he can like other people. Uh,
You bet.
Little things that disturb me,
and I know he's being a little hardnosed about it
but, uh, you know, this ring of honor thing, you know, he needs to be there because he's earned it.
Uh-huh.
He deserves it,
and he was the Dallas Cowboys,
and he won't do that yet.
Yes.
So. I hope he makes up his mind to do it, because he needs to be remembered.
Oh, he will.
Right.
Well, nobody's going to forget Tom Landry.
No,
no,
no.
Shoot, come now
Absolutely not
That's true,
but he needs to be honored,
I mean, I'd not a
let's put it that way.
you betcha.
I'm not a native Texan by birth
but, uh, I guess if I, uh, length of, length of time I'm in the state now, is what, after you're here twenty years you're considered native.
You bet.
I've been here since seventy-four,
and I feel like a native.
Well, let's see,
I came down March of sixty-nine, went to work for T and I.
Oh, did you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So, uh, I haven't looked back yet either,
so
We came, we came down from New York state in seventy-four, and uh, never had any regrets at all.
Right.
Especially looking at some of the weather New York state has had
You bet.
It's been.
and then look at the weather we have down here.
Huh
It's a great place to raise our kids,
and I've got my last kid graduating from college this next December
Uh-huh.
she's getting married the month before in November,
so
Oh, goodness.
I will have finished, be finished with that.
Well, we're well, we're finished with all but the last one, and trying to get him through his technical school
Right.
and, uh, we're, uh, he's over halfway,
so.
Well, good.
You know, we're not staying on the topic of television shows,
but I'm really not too concerned,
are you?
No,
not at all.
No,
me neither.
I'm enjoying the chat. Uh.
Well, I enjoy my T V programs.
I like those,
I like those detective programs.
I like everything.
I can watch Bill Cosby because I think he has a great show.

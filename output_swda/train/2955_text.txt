Well, I guess it depends on what age.
I am in the thirty something,
so I know,
I mean I lived through it.
Uh, are you old enough to know about the war?
Uh, just barely.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
I am, uh, twenty-nine.
Okay.
So, uh,
Well, yeah,
you are old enough.
Yeah.
But
But it was on the fringe.
just, uh, yeah,
exactly.
Had some friends that were, that were in it.
It ended, uh, when I was in, uh, college. In, uh, when I turned nineteen in nineteen seventy,
I cannot even remember at this point. Uh,
when I turned nineteen it was the year that, uh, the draft was still going on.
If I had been a male or in Israel, I would have been number two.
Really?
Yeah
Wowie!
So I learned a lesson in gender
Uh-huh.
Uh, in terms of the war, I do not know. Uh,
actually I do not really know that much about it.
I just know socially the impact it had here and what you hear in the media, you know. Uh,
I guess I think it was, uh, uh, not that great that we were in there, uh, in terms of for how long it lasted.
Right.
You know.
Uh-huh.
What do you think?
Well, I think it is, uh, basically the same way.
It is certainly has affected, uh, U S policy though.
There is, there is no question it had an overwhelming effect of how we approached the, the thing in, uh, Iraq.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Because, uh, the whole thing that was bad about Vietnam, it was no different from Iraq.
I mean it was, uh, one country picking on a smaller, weaker one.
Right.
The devastation,
yeah.
Yeah.
The only difference was that the government said, okay
if we were going to support this smaller country, then we are going to support it a hundred percent.
And we are going to consider ourselves against, in war, against these people as well.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
And in full faction,
Which, uh,
yeah.
Right.
Which really was not the attitude with Vietnam.
It was sort of, of a president's war rather than a country's war.
Yeah,
it just kind of dragged on.
Uh, I do not know how you were historically.
But I was a little bit older before I realized just how long it had been going on since L B J and
Right.
Yeah.
It seemed to me like it was, it seemed like it was going on forever,
I mean, I
Yeah.
yeah.
It really, well,
yeah,
in fact, because in terms of when your,
there is at least ten years between us,
so in terms of when you were in school, I am sure that it was, you know, the majority of your high school and junior high years.
Uh-huh.
Uh, one of the things I did not like was the weapons, the weapons, I can't even say it, the weaponry systems that they used.
Yeah.
Uh, it just did not seem that, uh, I do not know, technically we knew what we were doing either.
Right.
And then you heard about the things like agent orange, et cetera,
and you would think, you know, just, uh, how could the government or the Pentagon, uh, or whomever is in charge there been so careless.
Yeah,
right.
Uh,
Of course now uh, now everyone's more, uh, you know, environmentally uh, intelligent than they were back then.
Conscious,
yeah.
I mean back then it was not commonly known that saccharin was bad for you and all these other things that people that people know about themselves now.
Nutrisweet,
yeah,
and all these other things.
That is true, uh,
Uh, monetarily too, I just do not think we have done enough for the, uh, Vietnamese people as a whole. Uh, in South Vietnam, in general, in helping them restore themselves.
Uh-huh
You know, and I don't know if it is because there are not any oil fields there
Yeah.
I do not know if they, uh, I do not know if they have that resource or not.
Yeah.
I mean I do not think they do.
But I just think it is kind of a shame that, uh, you still hear things about the children that are orphans there
and,
Yeah.
uh, so on a whole, I do not know, war is not good.
And that one I probably,
uh, my main opinion would be we should not have done it.
Right.
Well, that is what I know about the Vietnam War
Yeah.
Unless you,
Yeah,
well, you know a little, uh, a little bit more than I do,
explain it.
I did not, uh, get to live through it.
That the people that I know that it did, uh, felt very strongly.
Uh-huh.
Most of,
I work for a government contractor.
Uh-huh.
So most of the guys I work with, are, uh, oh, at least some of the guys I work with rather are veterans.
Uh-huh.
Oh, Vietnam?
And, uh, from Vietnam.
Jeez,
yeah.
And, I have not talked to any of them that, that were not, you know, glad that they went or, or rather thought that the reason they went was a good one.
Uh-huh.
You know, most of them are very strongly that, that the reason for America to be there was a good one.
And that, that,
Uh-huh.
They just felt that the way America backed them up was not, was not at all right.
In terms of the personal.
Yeah.
In term of, uh,
Yeah.
The bitterness is more on a personal level than on a,
Yeah.
Personal level
and, and the finances, how they started. You know,
like air attacks and stuff like that dropped off like crazy.
Uh-huh.
Because the Congress would not approve, you know.
The money is
So, Yeah.
after,
yeah.
I mean, I think it started actually like, like in the late fifties. I mean like in fifty-eight, fifty-nine.
Huh.
I, I,
So it really,
I mean, because I know, in nineteen sixty-three, I mean I was nine years old, when Kennedy was shot.
Uh-huh.
So, I mean I remember, uh, right around then that's when I first started hearing about Vietnam.
But then as I got older and studied in school, I realized it was even going on before that.
Yeah.
You know, and you think to yourself, oh, my goodness, Eisenhower
Yeah,
right.
That sounds ancient,
yeah.
And I know, I know, you know, a lot of the Vietnam vets that are my age in their later thirties, uh, guys that I know, that, they are just kind of bitter, you know.
They, they, you know,
I hate to that movie BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY,
but it is that kind of idea.
Uh-huh.
You know, they just do not feel that socially they were given,
like a friend of mine called it the yellow ribbon syndrome.
Right,
Yeah.
They were not given the,
right,
the ticker tape parade and all that.
Yeah.
So, well, I won't keep you any more.
Okay.
That is probably as about as much as we both know
But thanks for talking to me.
Yes.
Uh, were you calling from Texas?
Uh, yes,
is that where you are at?
No,
I am in Falls Church, Virginia.
Oh, I know where that is.
That is beautiful where you are at.
Yeah,
right in, right near D C.
D C,
yeah.
Are you a native of there?
Uh, pretty much,
yep.
Been,
Yeah,
uh, Dallas, it is, uh, ninety-two degrees here today,
but at least the humidity is, uh, below forty percent, which makes it kind of like Phoenix.
Yeah.
It is about the same weather here.
Really?
Little bit, little bit cooler, like eighty-nine.
Well, you,
But, basically the same thing.
Yeah,
well you are not missing too much then
Yeah.
Right.
Really.
Well, take it easy.
Okay.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.

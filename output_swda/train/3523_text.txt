We're set.
Okay.
What changes do you feel have happened?
Oh, I guess the first thing has been the, uh, for the right, for women to vote.
I think that has been a major change and also the fact that, uh, there are so many more women in the work force nowadays than there were
and that's probably going to increase. You know.
Right.
Increases each year, doesn't it?
I'm sorry?
It increases each year I think.
It sure does.
Yeah,
there is a lot more women in the work place nowadays.
Well, and I think women have kind of had, uh, in the past the real subservient role.
Role?
Right.
And, uh,
That's changing
Well, we do to some degree
Right.
but, uh, uh, I think it's not as much as it was.
Right,
yeah,
I, I agree.
It definitely has changed.
I, And especially, I think with women increasingly working, they're going to have to demand more from men.
Uh-huh.
Because there is just, impossible to keep up on everything else.
Yeah,
yeah.
Have more of an active role in taking care of children, more of an active role in taking care of the home.
Well, you know, they've been talking about
and I don't know, uh, what the status is on it,
but, you know, women get maternity leave and stuff like that
and I know that they've, there has been discussion about men also getting maternity leave to help out,
Right.
but you know, I haven't really heard much about that recently.
Well, you know, there is a lot of companies that won't give women maternity leave for that very reason.
Uh-huh.
Uh, in fact, I know the school districts down here, you, they don't have maternity leave.
Uh you simply have to take, accumulate your sick leave. And take your sick leave.
Oh, is that right?
Oh.
Uh-huh.
And I don't know, uh, if bigger company companies do,
but when I was employed with the school district, I didn't have maternity leave either
and that was the reason
because they thought was showing prejisim to women and not to men
but, So, uh,
Huh, that's interesting.
That's a bummer, though
Yeah
it is.
I mean, You got to take the time off
You have to save all of your, uh, vacation time.
You do.
You have to save all your vacation time
and that's usually how it's, uh, happened,
Yeah.
but, uh,
Uh-huh.
What do you see, uh, changing in the future?
I think that we're probably going to see a lot more companies, uh, run by females.
Right,
and, and  top level.
And we'll
I'm sorry?
Maybe top level.
Right,
right,
upper management,
more women in upper management
and probably, uh, we'll see more females in political roles.
More governors and, I think, you know, roles like that.
That would be kind of nice
Well, we've got, in Texas, we have a female governor.
That's right,
that's right.
And we had a female mayor here in Dallas,
and she just, her term just ended
and, uh, so I think we're probably going to see more of that in the future
Yeah
I think that's probably good.
A little more integration.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, maybe not so much that we sit on the back burners
and,
Right, you know,
I mean, and that's fine with me
I think,
but sometimes,
I mean I'm not a women's libber by any means,
but I do,
Right.
there are issues that, you know, as far as, like, equal pay for men and women and that kind of stuff, I totally am for.
Right.
But, I don't get into the, uh, the real  women libber  movement, you know.
No,
I don't either.
I don't think they're ever going to prove that men and women are equal
Yeah.
We just function differently
Right,
right.
And, uh, I'm not capable of lifting what, uh, a man can lift and you know, that type of, that type of thing,
Yeah.
but, uh one of the big changes, uh, they're doing in Salt Lake is, uh,
Right.
and they're probably,
I'm sure, in Dallas since you're big places, a lot more women are, uh, working right out of their home with their P C's or with their lap computers or whatever.
Yeah,
I, I've heard of that.
Uh, I haven't really talked to anybody that's, you know, too involved with that.
But, I mean, I think that is a,
I think that,
Like the  cottage industry.
Is, is that what you're talking about, women working out of their homes?
Right.
Yeah,
uh, I think it's wonderful
Right.
You only have to check in with the office once or twice a week
and,
Yeah.
Course, they're talking about, uh, that we're going to be able to do our grocery shopping and banking and everything like that,
Oh, I
By the phone and all that.
so, uh, it would be kind of exciting in some ways to, to see a little bit more of that
and some ways, it might be kind of scary.
Right.
Think anybody could do it,
but, Anyway,
Right.
Yeah,
I wouldn't mind just calling up the grocery store and giving them my order and going an hour later and picking it up
Right.
Right,
but then you know, there is the process of selection.
Would you have to give them the brand You know, when you shop, you usually compare the prices
Right.
Right.
and, would be nice, though.

Okay.
All right.
Last thing I saw was, um, I think, uh, SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY with Julia Roberts.
Oh, I hadn't seen that,
but I've heard that it's real good.
My husband didn't like it that much.
I thought it was okay.
It was a little strange, you know,
this woman supposedly is, um, being mentally abused by her husband, you know,
he keeps her pretty much terrorized to stay in the house,
and she figures out this way to, um, to leave him secretly.
You know, she fakes her death kind of thing
and he tracks her down
Uh-huh.
Oh
So, the, the end scenes are, are kind of suspenseful, you know, when she realizes he's in the house, you know, after her,
but, uh, kind of had the feeling along that, uh,
why didn't she just tell him to straighten up.
Yeah.
You know, why didn't she just tell
Hey look bucko,
you don't get away with this nonsense
Oh
But anyhow, um, what have you seen?
Well, last week, as a matter of fact, my children was on Spring Break
Uh-huh.
and we went to two movies.
We went to see AWAKENINGS with Robin Williams.
Um.
Uh-huh.
And we went to see KINDERGARTEN COP.
Yeah.
And I really liked both of them.
I really did.
AWAKENING was, it was kind of sad to me.
It really was,
and it would, it would be to anyone because, you know, they really don't know that much about it.
Uh-huh.
So this is where the people have been kind of
I don't a better word to say than like asleep or in a coma, for a long time.
Yeah.
Yeah,
yeah.
And the drugs let them come back.
Uh-huh.
But the drugs didn't work for long,
and they started having real bad side effects.
Oh
And this is about nineteen sixty-four, I believe, or something like that,
and there still hasn't been any, you know, new development in prescribed drugs that can help it.
Um.
But, yeah,
there, you know,
it, it was a big breakthrough,
but in time, you know, the, all the side effects started showing.
Well, how bad were the side effects?
Bad.
Oh.
Yeah,
yeah.
They was actually went back like they were, you know,
Oh
Um.
yeah.
All it was,
they wasn't mild, you know,
they was just bad side effects.
Um.
But I really enjoyed it, though.
Um.
You know.
Well how about KINDERGARTEN COP?
Oh, yeah
That's strictly for entertainment
That was just
it was,
You know, Arnold Schwarzenegger is getting to be, uh, a bit of a variety actor, you know.
At first he was just a big muscle man.
Yeah.
But he's kind of branching out.
He sure is.
He is,
as a matter of fact, um, Sylvester Stallone, is that his name?
Uh-huh.
I really believe Schwarzenegger is really going to be a variety player more so than he is, because he really played the part good.
You know, he could be this rough, tough guy and then, you know, this substitute teacher.
Um.
It was really good.
Well, there was a movie out,
it's been on cable,
I get cable,
and there's this thing with, uh, Danny De Vito called TWINS.
Oh, I've seen that.
Yes.
I thought that was just great.
It is, it is,
isn't it?
Yes,
yes.
I even like some, I mean, some of the original stuff,
like I like THE TERMINATOR.
At first, you know, it was kind of strange,
Yeah.
but I still like watching him in THE TERMINATOR. And, and some of the other things.
Uh-huh.
Um, TOTAL RECALL last year I thought was really good, last summer.
Oh, yeah.
Guess it didn't last too long at the box office,
Yeah.
but I thought it was pretty good.
I did too,
I really did.
And,
I enjoy a lot of movies.
Now as far as, let's say, heavy violence, I can't handle
Um.
I'm not into that, you know,
I
like RAMBO and all that.
Um.
I,
that's just something I just don't want to watch.
Yeah,
yeah,
and I, I have some,
one person at work I know gets really into those goofy horror flicks
Oh.
and I just keep telling her, how can you do that?
And I told her when she had her, her little girl.
I said, now you better get out of the habit of watching those.
You shouldn't be watching them with your little girl,
and she says her little girl's into it now.
Oh, my goodness.
And she she watches these really gross things you know, like, THE NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, and, The, you know, that kind of, junk.
Yeah.
Oh, uh-huh.
Yeah,
uh-huh.
Oh.
I don't go for that at all.
I guess I'm a little too scary for that.
I remember when I was real little, I, we all went to some kind of scary movie,
and it was like this big house had a basement,
and there was all these weird things going on in the basement, you know,
and I was scared to death of our house had a basement for years.
Oh, uh-huh.
You know,
and I got a lot of really weird ideas, from that goofy movie.
Yes,
yes.
Yes.
You know, they tell you that kids can, you know, be impressed by all that stuff,
and it's true.
It is,
it really is,
yes.
I, I had a lot of things that I, I,
nobody told me that it was all fake.
I was just sitting there watching it, going a scared Oh, jeez
yeah.
Watching,
yes, if a scared
oh, I don't want to go home,
yes,
yes
Oh, goodness.
But I think a lot of kids, it's funny, get the same kind of fears, like there's somebody under the bed.
Yes.
Oh.
Where do we get that from?
Yes,
I know, uh,
I have two children.
I really try to watch what they watch,
I really do, because my youngest one, he watches something, you might as well just plan on staying up all night, because you know He'll come in,
Mama, I think the ghost is in the house,
Mama, I hear it,
don't you?
They're eight and ten.
So they're, you know,
it's just a movie, you know,
I try to say, it's just a movie,
but no,
Mama, I've seen it
Oh,
but I remember, I was with a friend of mine, had, uh, three kids,
and the little boy must have been, oh, maybe about ten.
And we rented CHARLOTTE'S WEB.
Okay.
Oh, uh-huh.
And he just bawled at the end and just a crying uh, she's not going to die.
Oh,
Oh.
And we were trying to say, Kenny, it's okay,
and he didn't want to listen to it.
Oh.
He just was beside himself, you know,
this is supposed to be a nice children's movie, CHARLOTTE'S WEB.
He just couldn't stand it that Charlotte was going to die at the end.
Die,
oh
Oh
It's funny how your little minds work,
isn't it?
Oh, yeah
a crying She's so nice,
she can't die
Oh
Oh, it was
Oh, I guess that's why the actors and actresses make millions of dollars,
people like us, you know
Oh,
Oh, goodness.
Well, well I've enjoyed talking to you.
You too.
And maybe we'll run across each other again.
Yeah,
this is kind of neat.
I haven't ever initiated a call.
I've just been called, you know, by the switchboard,
and, uh, well, the first week, I think, a lot more people were doing it.
But I normally get a call like every other day.
Do you?
Well, as far as,
we could not call in last week.
Um.
You know, from where I'm at. We couldn't call in.
Uh-huh.
They said it would be up Friday, the, March the fifteenth before it was prepared.
So I missed several days, because I was getting quite a few calls.
Um. How weird.
I don't know,
and they, they do have a variety of topics.
My first one was the toughest,
it was something like discuss pollution.
Oh, uh-huh,
oh.
It was discuss air pollution, causes of it and cures.
Yes.
I was going, oh, well
Oh.
Well, my husband, sometimes, you know, he'll receive a call
and he's at work,
Uh-huh.
and, if I, you know, if I know the topic I'll go ahead and accept it as mine,
but the other day I got one about fishing
and I thought, oh, my.
I don't know a thing about fishing,
so I'm not even going to try
Because when they listened to that tape they would have really had a good time,
believe me.
Say, well, I know it takes a fishing pole and some bait, and some water
Yeah,
but I'm really not for sure, though, if
Well, I'll let you go,
and we'll talk to you later.
All right.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.

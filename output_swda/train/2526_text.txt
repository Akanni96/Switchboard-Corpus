Okay,
what kind of car are you thinking about buying next?
Well, what a what do we currently have,
I have a Subaru, uh, G O X T.
What year?
Eighty-eight.
Oh, okay.
Well, I have a ninety Honda Civic,
and I'm ready to get rid of it
Actually,
Oh, it's not pretty old.
No,
uh, well, I I had an eighty-eight that I really liked
and it got wrecked,
and so I bought a ninety, um, because I, I really liked my eighty-eight
and I've had a lot of problems with this one,
so,
So, you think their quality control's going down over there, kind of ?
Well, you,
it's, it's kind of funny, um,
I know a lot,
Well, I, I, I think we're going to see that I think, uh, that the quality that the Japan carmakers had is slipping a little bit, while American carmakers are trying to get their, put together,
Oh.
Yeah.
so.
It's, it's true,
it's definitely true because,
But, but that's one reason
I, uh, I've had no problems with my Subaru,
that's one reason I went with it because I, Subaru had a good reputation, uh, for, you know, low maintenance,
so.
Yeah,
well, Honda does too that's why I was really,
Well, really,
there's, there's no question
but you have a nineteen,
I mean, I've got to see if ,
I mean, I've seen and I've had friends that have, uh, like, uh, eighty-one or eighty, uh, Celicas,
Uh-huh.
and those things just keep ticking.
Yeah.
I mean, they just, they can rack up a, a hundred fifty K on them,
That's true.
and they're still beating on them,
That's true.
and it's just amazing
and then they got,
and you know they're not making them like that now, you know,
No,
so,
not at all.
but they're still, they're still a lot, I think, definitely better than the American carmaker system .
Oh, I, I definitely agree with you there, because I had, uh, uh, uh, Ford T Bird before I got my Honda,
and it was the worst car I've ever owned
Yeah.
and, um, that's why, I mean, I was so tickled with my Honda
it was just a wonderful car
and then it got wrecked
and, you know, I wouldn't even look at another car
Yeah.
I just went and bought a Honda, I mean, I didn't even, I didn't look around or anything I just said that this is what I want,
and I really have had a lot of problems with it,
but I don't know.
Well, maybe you need to unload it on somebody
Well, I'll probably hold on to it since it's still under warranty
but in the first twelve months that I owned it, it was in the shop an average of about once a month,
it was in the shop about twelve times the first twelve months
Yeah,
that's a lot.
Yeah,
it was,
I was really disappointed because I was, you know, so, hyped up on Honda,
so.
Oh, well.
Yeah.
Anyway,
so, what's your next purchase supposed to be?
Well, I know this,
Oh, really ,
if you had a choice of your car, what would you get?
Well, it's, this is going to sound really strange,
but I really like to have a Mazda M P V van,
I really like those
and I have kids,
so.
I'm not sure I'm real familiar with the body style on that.
They're a lot,
I don't like the new style, like of the Toyota van, and the, the new Chevy Lumina van,
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
I don't like those styles, um, the M P V is more of, uh, uh, just, uh, I don't know what you, normal,
I don't know how to explain, more of an old fashioned type.
I, I'm not sure how to explain it,
Yeah.
I mean it looks, I guess, kind of like, uh, the Chevy Aerostar or Arrow,
Yeah.
no,
what
Astro, Astro, I guess, is what it, something like that,
Oh, okay,
yeah .
but I used to really like the looks of the M P V because it looks more like a mini van rather than I think,
Do you have, uh, do you have a family?
Yeah,
I have a couple kids
Okay,
well, that's probably influenced maybe a little bit .
Oh, yeah,
definitely.
But, I know that it's got to have a radio, it's got to have air conditioning,
I'm sure you can, uh, relate to air conditioning Um, living in Arizona,
Oh, yeah.
but, and cruise control and tinted windows, that's about it,
I mean, it's got to have those things, otherwise, I don't care.
Yeah,
well, when I bought my car, it was right out of college
and, uh, you know, I always been looking for something sporty
and I ended up getting, you know, basically something that I could, you know, afford.
Uh-huh.
The only gripe I have is performance.
I probably, uh,
a few girls that I've gone out with, I've had, uh, like Mazda R X sevens and stuff
and they're, they're pretty fun to drive,
so, so, I think that's what, uh, I, I'm going to have to get next time around, I keep, I keep holding off
Yeah.
Oh, really?
and then I could, I could upgrade now if I wanted to
but I just, I,
it's just such a huge expense
and, and, uh, I, I'm just going to keep holding off
but I'm definitely going to look for something, uh, in the, you know, nice, you know,
Sports car
I'd like to have a sports car too,
but it's not practical for me,
but,
Yeah
I'm in,
are you still there?
Yeah.
Whoops.
There's some kind of problems.
Hello,
Hello.
are you still there?
Okay.
This is,
something's wrong.
Wonder what happened.
I don't know,
it sounds funny though, doesn't it?
Huh,
anyway, um, but I'll probably, um,
Huh.
it just depends,
I know that's what I want,
but I don't know if I'll get myself to spend that kind of money,
you're looking at, you know, for a new R X seven or, a Supra or something,
you're looking at twenty-five K or something, that like
Oh, at least,
yeah,
and so, anyway but, Anyway my ultimate car though, the, the one that I really want is, uh, five sixty or so, Mercedes,
I know, well, new cars aren't cheap anyway,
but,
so,
Huh.
maybe someday
Yeah,
we have, we all have those kind of dreams too, don't we?
Yeah.
What I'd really like to have
That's the only one that I, you know,
I you know, I see, uh, you know, early on that, that, that says, it says, you there?
Yeah.
This is strange.
Hello.
Hello,
I think, something's wrong with this.
Okay.
I hope it's recording
I hope it's not my ,
you there?
Yeah
It may be my phone, um,
anyway it's the only car that says, you know, sporty and class, uh,
so,
Yeah,
you're right
Yeah.
uh, kind of what I'm,
but it's,
at the other one my brother's got a Miata
and those are fun.
Oh, those are nice,
And, uh,
yeah,
they're, they're cute cars
Yeah,
well, he did, he had a, a red Miata,
Uh-huh.
and, uh, he actually,
they came out with a European racing, green, uh, Miata that's a limited edition,
Oh.
they're only going to make like three or four thousand.
So, he went out
and he traded the other one in and got this one,
Wow, I haven't seen those.
and I'm like, um , but, uh, I haven't seen one yet either
but supposedly they have some real wood built in to like the clutch and all this and the steering wheel,
Wow.
so, it's, it's very authentic
and there only is supposed to be limited edition so it may be, may be a good investment.
If it,
Oh, yeah,
definitely.
Yeah.
If it's a limited edition usually, no matter what it is, if it's a limited edition, it's usually worth something later on.
Uh-huh.
But, uh, I think
hello,
Yeah.
okay,
yeah,
I got off my pace or my cordless phone, anyway, uh, hope it's not going bad,
Oh.
it's going to bump me out.
Um, but he, I think he, he only spent, you know, the low twentys
so, I don't know.
Really?
Now, see, I would have never figured that, I would have figured that to be a lot more than that for something that's limited edition.
Well, I don't know,
I think the demand's gone all, down a little bit.
I think you can,
the prices aren't as high, you know,
and the, the Miata was first introduced, uh,
And, well , they weren't really that bad though when they were introduced were they?
yeah,
the demand is so, high that, uh, you know, they were going to retail them around like you know, thirteen standard, you know,
and you get your options, your looking at fifteen or fifteen
Yeah.
That's true.
but there were, you know, people were buying them for nineteen and twenty,
Uh-huh.
and, um, they, they may have gone down a little bit
Huh.
but I,
they're still pretty much in demand.
I think there's another car coming in,
it's supposed to come out and compete with that Miata,
Huh.
and I can't remember what I read about that
but so, that's ,
I mean, I would think somebody would try to compete with that because it is very popular,
so.
Yeah,
it really is.
But,
Have you seen the new, uh, Dodge Stealth? The, the,  real nice one
Oh, yeah.
yeah,
and the Mitsubishi,  three thousand G T , is the same, same.
Yeah.
Yeah,
the Mitsubishi is real nice looking too,
Yeah,
well, that's, that's, that's the same manufacturer
now those are nice
and so , they just market them.
Right.
Right.
But, uh, yeah,
those are and those are supposed to be very performance power, I mean, they're, there is, yeah, big time.
The expensive ones, they have a cheaper model too that you can get for about seventeen thousand,
but those are pretty stripped,
and there's nothing,
there's really,
that one's just more for looks, you know,
it doesn't have any, really the performance that the expensive one does.
Yeah.
You know, but I've seen one of those,
and it's not that great, I mean, because they really,
I think they're only around, uh, twenty-nine K.
Yeah,
like, I mean they have, um, better ,
it's not quite as nice for a little bit less.
Yeah.
Yeah,
they're not really that bad
but I don't know,
like I said it's, it's still not practical for me
I have a hard time looking at cars like that because I think, now, there's no way I can do that
Yeah,
I'm being single
and no other responsibilities for yourself, I guess, you know, it's, I can, I can, I've been pretty happy,
Right.
I've, I've, haven't tried to upgrade myself right now,
that's, uh, you know, I could, I could have, you know, get something nice and upgrade
but I just, uh, I'm consulting right now,
so,
Oh, really?
I just made my first job hop about eight months ago,
so.
uh ...

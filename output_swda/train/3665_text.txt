Okay, uh,
some of the T V shows I like to watch are, uh, mostly evening, evening shows
and, uh, like for instance the one I'm looking forward to, to tonight is TWENTY TWENTY.
I usually watch those prime time programs.
Right.
Uh, I like to watch FORTY-EIGHT HOURS.
Never miss that and, uh, sometimes PRIME TIME LIVE.
Uh, and then the week goes by
and I don't think I ever watch anything else.
You know, the, the Sunday night movies, I watch those kind of things. But, uh, most, but basically a lot of documentary things and, you know, what's going on and that kind of thing.
I I have a few, you know, favorite shows that I try not to miss.
Uh-huh.
L A LAW is one of them.
Uh-huh.
Although this year's, it's a little easier to miss than last year. With the new cast and everything.
Yeah.
Yeah,
it's hard to follow.
Right,
and, uh, I like ROSIE O'NEILL.
Oh, I've never seen that one.
THE TRIALS OF ROSIE O'NEILL with Sharon Gless.
Okay,
yeah.
She,
I've seen a, uh, the previews for that.
It's very good.
It, it's probably very much a woman's uh, show.
Uh-huh.
But, uh, and then there's a new sitcom on that is, Tim Allen's, uh, what is it, uh, HANDYMAN.
That's not what, uh,
HOME IMPROVEMENT.
Oh, we never miss that,
or we try not to miss that.
It's hysterical, isn't it?
Oh, we think it is, so funny.
Did you catch the Christmas?
Oh, just part of it
I thought it was, you know,
and it had such a good story, too.
Uh-huh.
Did you see the end of it?
No.
Well, you know, the little boy, the little one was trying to decide if there was a Santa Claus.
Uh-huh,
oh, that's right
and the neighbor,
they thought it was the neighbor.
They thought it was the neighbor.
He gave the two doubting Thomases a rubber band and a paper clip.
Yeah.
I thought that was wonderful.
And then, uh, it, it's, it appeared that maybe it probably wasn't the neighbor.
And, uh, on Sunday, used to be on Sunday nights, now I can't figure out where they've moved it.
On our, uh, public television, they had a show at ten thirty that was a computer show.
Uh-huh.
And it showed the latest, uh, developments from all the computer companies.
Uh-huh,
I've never seen that program.
Well, you know, it's,
unless you're really into computers, you and software, you probably wouldn't be interested,
Uh-huh.
but I don't know,
Uh-huh.
it just really gave me kind of an outlook of what was available out there.
Oh.
And, uh, you know, what, they, they covered everything from entertainment to spreadsheets, you know, and then they also, the hardware.
Oh.
Uh-huh.
So you could see what the new developments were and what to look for
and, I enjoyed that.
Uh-huh.
It was just a thirty minute show with no commercials.
Oh, okay.
It's public television, course, doesn't have the commercials during the show
so,
Yeah,
right.
And I like the FRUGAL GOURMET.
Oh, I do, too
Oh, I do, too,
but I just seem to, to miss a lot of these programs.
I don't know why.
I just,
if I can catch them, I do. Or if I remember.
Well, there's very few that, you know, my life would stop if I didn't catch.
But, uh, now I do,
before I go to work, I tape my soap opera.
Oh, yeah.
I watch one
and,
Well, I watch two,
but one's a half-hour
and one's an hour
and, and they lead into each other.
Oh.
And that's the BOLD AND THE BEAUTIFUL and AS THE WORLD TURNS.
Oh, okay.
And I've watched the, AS THE WORLD TURNS since I was a little girl
Yeah,
that's been on for years.
So it's just, you know,
it's, it's, something I've done for the last probably twenty-five years.
Oh, and so you get to come home and watch them
Yes,
and I don't have anyone else at home,
so I have freedom to watch whatever I want.
Yeah.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
But I like, I like every, I like the, uh, the information shows
and I like the comedies
and you know, and I, I do like good movies.
Uh-huh.
I prescribed, subscribe to H B O.
Yeah
well, we,
So I can get some of the movies.
Yeah,
that's a good idea.
We did have H B O,
but it, we just canceled it last week because it seemed like it was so repetitious,  you know.
It is.
It's just,
But I don't sleep a whole lot
and I, you know,
at two o'clock in the morning, there isn't anything on regular T V
and,
Oh.
Oh, yes,
if you're up then
and you don't get good reception without cable
and it doesn't cost that much more to have one of the pay channels,
Yeah.
Right.
so that's primarily why I have it right now.
Right.
Yeah,
yeah.
I, I thought when I got my V C R, I'd probably drop it, you know,
but that was years,

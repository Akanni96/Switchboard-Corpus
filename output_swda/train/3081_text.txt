Okay,
well, I, I, I guess if I was having a dinner party I, depending on the number of people, I might cook a, like a brisket or a roast or a, maybe a chicken dish
Uh-huh.
and, um, I guess I usually plan probably a lettuce salad and a, a potato dish,
and we usually serve fresh fruit and, uh, then make a dessert.
Oh, that sounds good.
So that makes,
Uh, we're not, uh, real wealthy at the moment.
Last time I had people over for dinner we had lasagna,
and I used my mother's recipe,
I really like it.
It's got, um,
you cook the noodles and make, and brown hamburger and put tomato sauce in with it
and, I'm not sure she even puts,
must be some Italian spices in there.
I can't remember.
But, um, for the cheese part, you mix, uh, sour cream, and cream cheese and cottage cheese and, uh, layer all that.
Well, that sounds good.
It's good.
That sounds good.
And, then, uh, uh, tossed salad and, and, um, someone in the Oh,
my goodness, Diane, get down from there.
to And, uh, let's see,
what else did I serve with that.
Bread, do you have bread to go with it?
Corn,
yeah,
I made French bread with that one too.
Gosh.
I have a recipe that's pretty good for that
So.
Oh, well, lasagna's always wonderful for large crowds.
Yeah.
I've heard, you know, I've heard a lot of people say, it, the short cut on the cooking for lasagna,
they, they've told me that they go to Sam's and buy a great big pan of lasagna.
I've heard that Sam's has a really good lasagna
So.
in fact I think I had it at a, at a party once.
Did you?
It was good.
Well, I, I know people that have, have served it
and they say, gosh, if you have company coming when you don't want to be always in the kitchen, it's easy,
Easy
and she said it's, they said it's good.
Yeah.
So, that, that's always sounds good to me, um,
Yeah.
I feel like, I feel like I'm in the kitchen cooking a lot.
Oh, I know.
I cook, guess I cook a, seems like I cook a lot of dinners, oh, not always for company, just for, just for family.
Oh, yeah.
So, feels like I'm often in the kitchen.
Not my favorite place, but. A necessity
But a time consuming place.
Yeah,
right,
right,
so.
Let's see,
what else do we like to have for,
trying to think what else I like to serve.
My mother likes to serve taco grandes.
Have you  ever had,   that?
I don't know,
what  that is.
No
I don't know what that is.
You take a flour tortilla
and you fry it like a taco shell
Okay.
Right.
and you, uh,
for all the inside parts you brown hamburger and put some, um, tomato sauce in it,
and, and I like to just add picante sauce to get the Mexican flavor
so you don't have to mess with spices and stuff.
Right.
And, then, um, let's see,
and then, and you heat up refried beans,
and you cut up tomatoes and lettuce and grated cheese,
and what you do to make it, you take the shell and you spread the beans on first,
then you put the meat,
then you put the grated cheese,
and then you put, um,
let's see, what's next,
then, and I, I usually put the cut up tomatoes next and then the, um, lettuce,
Right.
and you can put, uh, like guacamole and someone in the
Katy, I'm on the phone.
Well, get a towel or go change.
I'm on the phone.
to Um, oh a little sour cream is good and, and chopped olives,
Right.
Right.
Do you like to make your own guacamole?
Uh, yeah.
Yeah,
we, we don't make it very often, I guess,
but, uh,
No,
I don't very often.
Usually when we get avocados my kids just like to eat them plain
Oh do they?
so. Yeah.
Gosh,
I just cut slices off
and. I like an avocado sandwich, too.
Gosh,
Oh, that's good,
that's good,
or it's always good on top of something in the sandwich.
Yeah,
yeah.
Oh, well, we made, I made guacamole that I would take to a pool party across the street the other day,
and, and everyone there said they never made guacamole salad.
off What you want.
to where do they get it?
Well, I don't know,
I guess they don't have it at home,
I can't imagine it would stay fresh long enough to,
I guess they just buy it at a restaurant when they eat it at a restaurant maybe.
They must, they just said they never had it at home.
So I, I was concerned that, I thought, oh, taking this, you know, taking this as a dip, I thought, gosh, you know, sometimes when we have it at home it, it turns dark on the top so quickly,
Yeah.
so I just,
It helps if you, I helps if you leave the pit in it.
Oh, does that help?
Yeah,
if you leave the pit in the bowl with the thing, especially while you're waiting before you serve it.
Okay,
well,
That's supposed to help keep the, um, keep it from turning brown so quick.
Well, I'll have to remember that.
Well, I just, I, that day I just took extra lemon and just squeezed across the top
and it really stayed longer than I ever thought it would,
Oh.
so.
Oh, that's good.
I thought maybe that was the trick.
That probably helps, too.
Yeah,
yeah,
so. Oh, well. I guess we bought a lot of,
we've been buying turkey lately, instead of beef,
so
Do you want it?
even though, you know,
Oh, yeah
we have too,
the ground turkey,  it's, the meat is softer
and I,
everybody seems to like it.
Do you want scrambled?
So. Sometimes it seems to be cheaper, too,
so we often buy it
Yeah.
Yeah
we buy it,
if you get it on sale,
Yeah,
yeah,
so we bought that
or we bought the, the filets, and then the chicken, or turkey nuggets,
and I don't think anybody in my house knows the difference, unless you tell them.
Yeah,
yeah
Or in,
I don't think mine know either.
In fact, we've been getting lunch meat that's turkey, too.
It costs less than the other,
I don't know,
there's supposed to be something more healthy about it
Yeah,
yeah.
Poultry instead of the beef and pork,
yeah
right,
right.
Well, I guess that's probably all we need to do for tonight.
Yeah,
I, I can't think of any other specific things I like to serve. Um,
I always like dessert
One salad that we always like, my sister-in-law always brings to family dinners, is a,
I don't know what you call it.
Uh, you mix, um, cottage cheese and a package of jello and a thing of, uh, like Cool Whip
Right,
right
that's good and quick and easy,
that's always good,
Probably, probably the only family recipe that we, we make and it's really for special occasions is cheese cake,
and we take a recipe from my grandmother, you know
Uh-huh.
it's probably fairly typical, cream cheese and egg and sugar, and the insides of a,

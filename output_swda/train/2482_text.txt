Uh, so, you have children I take it?
like she is cooking, i. e. banging pots, water, No,
I don't.
You don't?
No,
huh-uh.
So, it's not a very valid topic.
No,
it's not.
Do you have children?
Uh, yes.
Uh-huh.
One.
One.
Stepdaughter.
Uh-huh.
Ten.
Ten.
And, uh, you know how they are at that age, I guess. you having been ten once, yourself.
Yeah.
Once upon a time I was.
Well, I have two dogs,
those are my kids.
Oh, we have one.
What kind is it?
A Keeshonden.
Oh, really.
Yeah,
Uh-huh  .
fuzzy  little thing.
A what?
A fuzzy little dog.
Yeah,
yeah,
they're cute.
Rather, rather odd personality,
he, he's fun.
Uh-huh.
Anyway, uh, time we spend with our children.
Uh-huh.
It seems almost as though children hate it.
Do they?
Yes.
Time spent with Mom and Dad is, uh, next, is probably one of the worst punishments spent on earth to them.
Yeah,
especially when they get like into the teenage stage.
Yeah.
I guess.
Yeah,
I remember when I was that age.
They, you know,
parents are a curse that they just have to live with.
Uh-huh.
So, it, it's interesting.
Yeah.
But we do spend time driving in the mountains,
and ...
Uh-huh.
Oh, how nice,
I would love to live up there.
Well.
Do you work for T I?
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
You're working then?
Yeah.
With every passing day we wonder if we will be.
That's what I heard.
like running I've always thought about maybe transferring up there,
and I thought if I do that, I might not have a job
so
It's, it's better to be employed.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Especially these days where there is not a job right around the corner.
Uh-huh.
I know it.
And that creates family tensions.
Yeah.
Yeah,
I'm sure it does.
So, you only have the, you only have the stepdaughter at home?
Yes.
You all don't have any other children around there?
No,
no.
I don't have any, children.
Uh-huh.
So, how does she feel about going out and doing stuff with you all.
Uh, well it varies what it is, of course,
but usually, Mom and Dad are a curse.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
You know, they, they'd much rather be with friends,
Oh,  yeah  .
friends  are cool, parents aren't.
No,
huh-uh.
Well, I remember,
well I'm sure part of it is a male, female thing, you know,
Uh-huh.
I, I remember whenever I was growing up, often times spent with my Dad was, oh, just wonderful, you know, go, go hunting, or go to the races, or, or, oh, any number of things.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
And we'd have, um, great times,
Oh, yeah.
and it seems that well now the bank's not available.
Yeah.
Um. Uh-huh.
And, entirely too much time is spent,
my wife and I were wondering what if,
and, and what if's always rough.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
But, you know, we do have our trips
and we do have our fun
and, I don't know, little girls aren't interested in lot of the same things little boys are or were.
Uh-huh.
Like fishing and ...
Hunting and, and, Looking for arrowheads, and ...
Yeah.
My husband will say that he'd like to have a little boy to take hunting and fishing
and I said, well, you can take a little girl hunting and fishing just as easily.
Uh, but they don't like it.
That's probably right.
There, there, there is a difference there.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
And, and ...
No,
if my Dad had done that when I was a kid I probably wouldn't have liked it.
I go now, with my husband.
And, I enjoy it,
but ...
Well, girls at that age, Video games, boys and malls.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
yeah.
Not necessarily in that order, and friends of course.
Uh-huh.
And, that's a little tough for fathers.
Uh-huh.
I imagine.
Fathers don't even like malls,
they despise shopping.
Uh.
So, is that quality time?
Huh,
no,
I think not.
Yeah,
if,
but there is camping
and we both enjoy that.
Uh-huh,
she likes to do that?
Somewhat, yeah,
yeah  .
Yeah
, yeah.
Well, that's good.
Getting up in the mountains and getting away from it all
and, that's somewhat fun.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
She  ...
It's  ,
Huh?
so what do you think about child rearing?
Is,
how, how would you spend time with kids?
Probably doing outdoorsie stuff, and keeping, trying to keep them away from the T V, I guess And, McDonald's
Oh, yeah.
I, I always said that if I had a kid they wouldn't know what McDonald's is.
Yeah,
but
But  , they learn from their friends,
don't they?
Well, yeah,
and amazingly a lot of times it's real easy.
Uh-huh.
You know, a lot of times, whenever we head out of town on a trip or something, it's real easy to swing in there for breakfast.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Breakfast and run.
Yeah.
And breakfast is a kind of a funny meal anyway,
Yeah.
It is.
and, uh, kids eat funny.
This lady in our bass club, we had a tournament yesterday
and she was talking about her daughter, said, one week her daughter will, uh, be on a no meat kick,
and one week she'll eat nothing but Twix candy bars, you know,
she just eats weird.
And little girls are worse about it than little boys.
Yeah,
yeah.
They ...
They're always wanting to go on a diet or something.
Or, or something, yeah.
Uh-huh.
Go on a diet or they, they have a, well,
to some extent the public schools, or the schools in general, influence them, the eating meat kick.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
You know, like it's really morally wrong to eat meat or something, I, I'm not sure.
Uh-huh.
Of course, that's not the way I was raised, being raised in West Texas.
Yeah.
Oh, is that where you're from?
Oh, yeah.
Uh-huh.
Born in Denton, raised in Lubbock.
Oh. Um.
So, I understand about bass.
Yeah
Huh.
But it, but it is interesting,
Uh-huh.
I, I will tell you,
yeah.
Every person out there should have kids, at least once or, or have some they can borrow for a time, because everyone needs some torture in their lives.
That's the kind I like.
My Mother used to put that curse on my sister.
I hope you have kids just like yourself.
And, my Grandmother must have put that on my Dad because he got my sister,
she's just like him.
Uh. But, Jenny is a sweet kid.
Yeah,
I'm sure she is.
And, yeah,
we do do things,
Yeah.
and, it, it's funny,
it's almost like a lot of things that were available to us as children, to go do,
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
The money's not available.
Uh-huh,
I know,
I don't know how people can afford kids.
I mean  ...
You know  , we were talking about how much it cost to go to Disney Land.
Uh-huh.
Golly!
A couple,
three hundred dollars.
Oh, yeah.
You know, for just, for just a day, not you know, a day or two, not including lodging and food and all that.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
It's,
I don't see how anyone can afford it.
Uh.
And, I understand Six Flags is real expensive now.
It's, uh,
I heard it's twenty bucks a whack.
For adults.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
That is awful high.
Oh, well ...
Twenty bucks a whack now.
Yeah,
or twenty-one.
But, at least once you pay your way in there,  at Six Flags  ...
Yeah,
yeah  .
yeah,
everything's free except for the food.
Yeah,
yeah,
food and junk to carry out.
So that's, that's not as bad.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But, golly!
You know, Disney World or Disney Land.
Uh-huh.
Well, our problem is that, you know, a trip to Six Flags or Disney World or, uh, Disney Land, or God forbid, Disney World, would take forever.
Really.
Or you'd have to pay air fare,
Uh-huh.
and, ooh, for a family, you know, for a family it gets pretty expensive pretty quick.
OH, yeah.
Rent a car when you get there and all that.
Yeah.
That's why I lucked out,
my Dad worked for Braniff when I was a kid so we got, you know, our air fare free
and we got ...

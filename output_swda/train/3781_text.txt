Well, I suppose we both have credit cards.
Uh-huh,
yeah,
they seem to be a part of life
Yeah.
Yeah,
how do you use them?
Well, I do use them.
Uh-huh.
Uh, I have a few favorites that I use more than others
and, uh, I try to keep my balances fairly reasonable.
I, I could probably pay them off any month if I wanted to.
Uh-huh.
Uh, but occasionally they can get out of hand and get higher when, when you start using more than a few
Uh-huh.
and, uh, they all can build up.
Uh-huh.
Uh, I think they're handy.
I just get, uh,
I don't carry a lot of cash with me
Uh-huh.
and, uh, I hate writing checks when you go shopping.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Well, do you use credit cards?
Yeah,
I use a few.
I, uh, I watched my grandmother go into debt on them
Uh-huh.
and so I've,
and then I guess my  mother,
Grandmother
huh?
Yeah,
so my mother learned from that
and I guess she taught me to be very, very careful with them.
So basically, uh, I just keep them,
I use them so that I build up a credit rating, you know.
Uh-huh.
But, otherwise, uh, I generally,
and my husband, it turns out,
I've just been married seven months,
but he has the same habit
and we just keep a few you know, few of the major ones, and then use them once in a while for something,
That's good.
but we always pay it off right that month so that we don't pay any service charge.
Oh that's, That's wonderful.
So that way we keep out of debt
and we keep on top of what we're spending.
Well, the interest rates in credit cards is so high now  compared  to what your savings is bringing.
Yeah.
It's really, I guess ridiculous to let them keep building.
Yeah,
yeah,
that's what I feel.
So,
But I know some people can get, get, you know, carried away with them and let them get out of hand.
Uh-huh.
It's really easy, just to forget, you know, that you, you charged that or charged that.
I try to keep all my receipts and keep them in someplace where I know that the bill's going to come,
but sometimes I forget
and so, you know, a bill will come in
and I'll think, oh, no I didn't know it was going to be that high.
Uh-huh.
yeah.
But so far, I've been able to, we've been able to pay it off every time
so,
Well, that's good.
I'm looking, right now I'm kind of looking for a Visa that has a lower interest rate.
It seems that some of them have gotten higher
Uh-huh.
and, uh, I saw on T V, they had a program on, uh, credit cards
and they're supposed to,
I don't know if it was Tennessee or Arkansas or some, some other state had a Visa card that was the lowest one in the country.
And I didn't write it down at the time
Uh-huh.
and then I went and looked and, to see what my visa was
and I think it's eighteen percent or something
Um.
so, think I want to find something that has a lower rate.
Yeah.
Have you ever used Discover card?
No,
I haven't.
Yeah,
I'm not even sure what their interest rate is since I pay it off
but you know,
Is that the one from Sears?
Uh, I think Sears originally put it out,
Okay.
but it's, uh, it's pretty well taken all over the U S now.
I mean, uh, I've haven't found many places that don't take Discover.
And there's no annual service fee, which is good.
Okay  .
You know,  and then, uh, they also give you, they say cash back, uh, like at the end of the year.
For the amount that I charge, I get two dollars back or something
Uh-huh.
but if you use credit cards a lot you probably get more back.
Oh, they give you money back for using your credit card.
Yeah,
basically.
Oh
That's it.
I didn't know that.
And I think the service charge is pretty low, too,
but, I'm not sure.
Um. Well, you know, Sears was one of the few department stores that never would take any other credit cards.
Uh-huh.
I worked at Sears for over ten years
and, uh, it was only a Sears card that they would take until I guess they decided to join the club and come up with their own credit card, another credit card that was accepted,
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
so, you know, now they'll take the Discover,
but I still don't know if Sears will take Visa or Mastercard.
Uh-huh.
But, uh  I  never did apply for a Discover card.
Yeah.
I just figure with the Visa and American Express, I probably have an,
Uh-huh.
I can do enough damage with those two.
Yeah,
I think it's best to keep the number down that you have.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
So,
I've got some that I, you know, I haven't even used at all, uh, past few years
I probably wouldn't be able to use them.
Uh-huh.
But, uh, I, I do like my Dillard's,
I have to admit that's one of my favorite places to shop.
Uh-huh.
And I do use Dillard's probably as, more than any of the other department stores.
Uh-huh.
But,
Yeah.
Well, Do you have anything else to say?
Well,
No,
not too much more about credit cards
Okay
I don't think I do either
so,
Okay
well,
Well, it was good talking to you.
Good talking to you Beth.
Okay.
Good luck.
Have a good evening.
You, too.
Bye-bye.
Bye.

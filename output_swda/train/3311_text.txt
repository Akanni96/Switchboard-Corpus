All right, uh, well,
let's see,
How old are you Lisa?
I'm twenty.
Okay.
How old are you?
I'm older.
Older
Older than you are.
Okay.
Okay,
we are supposed to talk about places we like to go.
So I'm going,
and where are you from, where are you calling from?
I'm calling from, uh, Provo, Utah,
but I'm from Plano, Texas.
Oh, you are from Plano.
My sister lives in Plano.
Oh, really?
Yes,
her husband is the new Director of Admissions at, uh, University of Texas at Dallas.
Oh, wow.
Yeah,
so,
Anyway, so, where's your favorite place to go?
My grandparents live there.
That's generally our usual summer vacation.
Where in Arizona?
Uh, Tempe.
Okay,
I've never been to Tempe.
So,
That's where I'd like to go.
What do you like about Tempe?
Uh, mainly just being with family is it.
We just hang out
and my grandparents have a pool
so we go swimming
and, uh,
Pretty hot isn't it, in the summer?
Yeah
but we keep cool just by going swimming
and it's fun to be with my cousins.
They're up there also, my grandparents and my cousins.
That's good.
Uh-huh.
So,
Been to Hawaii?
No,
have you?
Yes,
in fact, I just got some reservations.
I'm going to go for, uh, almost two weeks this winter.
Oh, my goodness.
Yes.
It's the longest,
well actually I lived there,
so I was there longer,
but two weeks is the longest vacation I'll have ever taken there,
so I'm kind of looking forward to that one.
Wow.
Around Christmas time?
Uh, no,
in March.
Oh.
We're going to go in March after my children's birthdays and get all that business out of the way.
Wow.
Yeah,
so I think, I would like to go to Arizona.
I mean, I was in Phoenix in January, last January
but it was rainy and icky.
Oh, really?
It was the coldest it's been there ever in January
I think. It's very cold.
So, do you travel a lot
But, I would like to go to Tempe.
or,
Do we travel a lot?
Uh, some, yeah.
Well, I've been a, I was a travel agent.
Oh.
I mean, I have been up until just a few months ago.
But I'm thinking of going back to work
Huh.
Yeah.
So you know a lot of good vacation spots, huh.
I I know a lot of good places to go.
But you definitely need to go to Hawaii.
Very definitely.
That's your favorite?
Yes,
it is my favorite.
My husband hasn't been to Europe yet
and I'd like to take him there.
And, but he's traveled all over the United States
and I haven't.
Like, I haven't been down south.
I'd like to go to New Orleans.
Have you been there?
I haven't.
Where, where do you live?
We, I live in Yakima, Washington.
Wow.
So it's cold and rainy today.
It's yucky.
Um.
But we've had some pretty nice weather.
We played tennis outdoors until last week,
so that's a pretty good deal.
Um.
So do you go to school in Provo, Utah?
I do.
Do you use NuSkin skin care.
They're located in Provo.
I work for NuSkin
Do you?
Yes.
I'm a NuSkin person.
Oh, really?
Yeah,
I sell NuSkin, too.
I, I am my only
Oh, my goodness.
and best
not only and best
but I'm my best customer.
Great
Since we're not supposed to talk about this, though, is there anything more intensive for the eye area than the eye cream?
Uh,
Do you know?
I don't,
probably, maybe the rejuvenating cream is the only other thing I would use.
I have that, too.
I'm forty-two,
I need something,
I need more.
Than the intensive eye?
Yeah.
I didn't know if there was anything else.
And I use the Celltrex.
Uh-huh.
But anyway,
well, yes,
NuSkin is wonderful.
Good,
yes.
I think it's a wonderful product.
Do you use it?
I do,
yeah,
we get free products every month
so,
Oh, my gosh.
That's great.
Right, right
now I'm getting about sixty bucks a month, free products
so,
Yeah,
oh, yeah.
I've worked there about a year.
That's good.
Are they good to work for?
Yes,
they're wonderful to work for.
That's great.
Yep
Anyway, so we're supposed to be talking about places to go
and you have not been to Europe.
Do you go to school?
Uh-huh.
Do you ski?
I ski, yes.
I've,
Ski,
you probably ski very well in Utah.
No,
I don't
Actually since I grew up in Texas I've only been here about two years and have gone skiing about three times. well, five times each season.
Uh.
Why did you move to Utah?
You're going, oh, you are going to school? At B Y U,
Yeah,
I,
is that where B Y U is?
Uh-huh.
Yep.
Okay,
I know some people that went to B Y U.
That's great.
Pretty good.
I do like to ski.
Pretty, pretty down there. Huh?
Yeah,
I, I said I do like to ski.
So, where, have you skied?
And it's, it's kind of nice being up here just because it's all like a vacation in itself when you get to go.
Sure.
If you like that kind of thing
Sure,
so you're a sophomore. Or junior?
I am actually a junior. Beginning of my junior year.
You're a junior.
Good for you.
So,
What are you studying?
Nursing.
Good for you.
You sound like a girl that has it together.
I would just encourage you to do a little traveling, though, before you get married.
Because when you get married, you won't have the money or the time.
You think,
I know.
So just, you know,
don't, don't be in any hurry.
I'm not, I'm not.
You really should go to Europe.
I went to Europe for six weeks after I graduated from college
and that was just,
I, I mean I could have had that or a down payment on a new car
and I took the trip.
And
And it was great?
uh, I traveled with a group of sixteen other students.
Actually they, there was two other graduating seniors besides myself,
and we just had a ball.
We stayed at,
How long did you get to stay there?
Uh, six weeks.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
It was wonderful,
so you should think about doing something like that.
Uh-huh,
I just had a friend that got back from Europe
and she was there like all winter semester.

an interesting topic.
Yes.
The, uh, type of cars that I was, uh, I would be most interested in if I was going to buy another car now would probably be something like a, uh, Mazda Miata.
Uh-huh.
Uh, the, uh,
I'm very much a, a fan of sports cars.
Ah.
Boy,  you and my husband would have a whole lot in common
The,
The, uh,
uh, uh, though, actually, in
actually if I
I have
I've avoided buying a new car for quite some time.
I'd rather put my money into, uh, restoring my old cars.
I have a old Triumph T R Six.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, uh, so, uh,
but if I was to buy one, probably something like a Miata.
It's certainly,
I wouldn't have to worry about it breaking down all the time
Oh, really.
Yeah
What's the,
how old is your car?
Uh, well I have a, I have a nineteen eighty, uh, eighty-five C R X.
Oh.
Uh, which is, you know,  it's,
it still works fine
Yeah.
Right.
But it's, it's actually,  it's kind of annoying cause I've got no reason to replace it
Oh.
But, uh, Oh, those are,
Yeah.
So what do the Miatas run?
they're about, uh, uh, thirteen to fourteen thousand dollars and, you know, a bit more if you add some some options  and so on
but  the,
Well, that's not  too bad.
uh, yeah,
that's a pretty good price
and  they're, they're, they're, they're so nice to drive.
Yeah.
Really?
I've never driven one.
Uh, uh, it's, it's, it's nice.
They're,
I've been down to a dealer and driven them.
And I've also driven one at a, something Mazda put on where, uh, they went to, uh, autocross events across the country. Uh, which is where you race in, uh, you race on, in a parking lot or something like that with a bunch of, uh, cones to see who can get through the fastest.
Huh?
Uh, you know, about a minute or so. And, uh, very twisty stuff.
Uh-huh.
And oh, it handles so nicely.
And so you've done this?
Yeah.
Oh.
Okay.
Yeah.
Oh
It  was just,
it, it's just so smooth
and.
Really?
Yeah
Yeah.
Nice car.
What are you interested in?
Whatever my husband buys
Yeah.
You  you don't get involved in,  uh, car decisions?
Oh, not too much.
No.
We, uh, we just got rid of a full conversion van that, that I, I, that wasn't me.
That was my husband.
He wanted a van
and he wanted to drive that van and travel and wanted everything in there. T V, you know, the whole bit.
But I never drove it
so it just, it wasn't me, you know.
Yeah.
I can understand.
And then,  Oh, I'd want a minivan
yeah.
They're nice.
Because I'm  with the kids all the time.
Oh, yeah.
That's  perfect for that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And,
It's not,
it, it's small enough that it's easy to drive.
Yeah.
You pick up  I pick up my little one from preschool
Holds a lot.
and the whole parking lot's full of minivans.
Yeah.
But, you know, I, I drive a little Subaru.
Yeah.
And, uh, we, I love that.
I,
we were going to trade that in for the van
but I just wanted to hold on to it cause I just really enjoy that.
Right.
And, uh, that's really all I needed was for something just to go here and there  and back.
Yeah.
Minivans are nice.
I have a friend who has a minivan.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, I've driven it a few times
and, uh, it's nice,
it's nice.
Of course, you know, my my family has always had cars like that. Uh, in that, you know, my father's had a, had a, always had a V W bus every since, uh nine, about nineteen sixty or so.
Oh, really
Oh, really.
Uh,  uh,
they, well,
he, he used it,
he often has to transport plants or, uh,  things  like that cause he's, he goes to orchid shows and, and, you know, fills the car with plants. And so on
Yeah.
or .
Yeah.
It's amazing what a minivan can do.
We went camping this past weekend with some friends that had a minivan. And pulled the, uh, the little trailer behind.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
The pop-up trailer?
Uh-huh.
And, uh, it's,
so it's really amazing how much a minivan you know, what it can do.
Yeah.
And they're not that expensive.
No,
they're not.
Yeah.
They're probably  .
Mainly because everyone  makes them, you know
Yeah.
You can take your choice of how expensive you want it to be.
Yeah.
And we, we do a lot of, uh, driving.
We do a lot of traveling. By car.
Uh-huh
And so that's the only time that the, that the, uh, conversion van came in handy.
But it really didn't cause our, our kids are still little.
Uh-huh.
So, uh, that was the only time we really needed it.
Other than that, it got terrible mileage
and.
Yeah
Yeah.
Minivans do pretty well. You know, twenty, twenty, twenty-five miles per gallon or more.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Some of them probably even do thirty.
Yeah.
The, uh,
yeah.
There, there's some other cars I'd like
but I, I would never be willing to send quite that much money for, uh, like, uh, uh,
I'll drool over them.

All right, do you do exercise?
I do,
yes,
I, uh, uh, I guess it actually changes,
I do a number of different things simply walking with my wife
Uh-huh.
Right.
and sometimes my daughter will come along on her little bicycle.
Uh, and then moving up, I run in the mornings,
Uh-huh
not every morning, it probably averages about two days a week
Right.
and then with my wife I actually go to the gym and lift weights, which isn't, I understand, quite exercising,
but it's along the lines,
Right.
How about yourself.
Well, um, that's a hard question to answer because I do physical things, but I don't always set out for them to be exercise.
Uh-huh.
I walk with my parents, occasionally,
nothing's real regular about this because I have a weird schedule and they have a normal schedule,
and, um, I play racquetball,
but I haven't since I've been out of school.
I don't have anywhere to do that,
but that's going to start soon again
Uh-huh.
and, um, I play softball once a week, which is kind of more recreation than exercise.
Uh-huh.
Because I really don't like to exercise,
I think that's the basic point of it, is I'm not, I, I don't enjoy it if I know that it's exercise,
Right.
but if it's like a social activity or a recreational activity, I don't mind
Right.
so I have to disguise it,
it's like feeding little babies food and telling them it's something else so that they'll eat it.
That's right.
That's kind of the same thing for me.
I have to not know that it's exercise so I can do it.
Right.
So you look at it more as a task.
Well, yeah,
if it's exercise, it's a task.
Right.
I don't want to do anything I have to do.
I see.
I mean, I'll voluntarily clean the bathroom,
but I won't do it if I have to do it.
Right,
right.
So, I'm thirty-two years old which is probably different than yourself
Uh-huh.
Right,
I'm twenty-two.
and so, it's interesting that as you get older you begin to understand that you need to exercise.
Right.
My job at Texas Instruments, I have to sit in front of a computer all day and make phone calls, so, that, I don't get any exercise doing that
Right.
and plus there's a build up of stress
Uh-huh.
so I need to go out and take those walks after dinner,
and I need to go out in the morning and run
or I'll just get nuts
Right.
so that's kind of a motivator,
so even though I can look at it as a task, the, you know, I kind of get the, I get some kind of global benefit from the whole thing by saying, Well, I'm lowering my chance of heart attack, and thus, that type stuff.
Right.
Eating right and no cholesterol and all that.
Sure,
that all,
I, I do all that.
Yeah,
we,
I'm sure, I will do,
I'm doing that more and more than I used to
Yeah.
I'm getting better about this knowing that I need exercise and doing it, but it's still at the task stage.
Right.
Is it a pleasure for you,
or are you,
Well, it's a,
something as simple as a walk with my wife is very enjoyable.
Right.
I do that at the end of the day,
and it takes, you know,
that, that during that time the stress from the day goes away.
I get to share whatever I did with my wife, and, and vice versa.
Right.
Going to the gym is, is actually something different than, than, like,
oh, and the running,
and I enjoy that too.
Uh-huh
Year,
I've been running since high school on track teams and the like,
Oh.
so, running, I, I'm at that point which you probably get to after about six months of dedicated running where you don't feel your muscles any more
Uh-huh.
Right,
and you don't think about the pain of it.
You, you, you take the time to relax some how
and you think about other things.
During those first few months you have to think about running and why your elbow hurts and why you can't breathe and this and that,
Uh-huh
and that's no fun.
And it's so hard to get past that for a lot of people.
Right,
that's,
I never got past that stage.
Yeah,
the the, uh, weight lifting on the other hand is actually, you know,
I think I look better.
Right.
I have just a, I don't, I'm not a huge person,
I'm just a regular looking guy,
but just going to lift weights on occasion with my wife,
and my wife thinks the same thing about both me and herself that get that little bit of definition in your muscles is, is attractive
Uh-huh.
Right.
so that pays also.
That's good.
Yeah,
so, so I guess that aspect of that takes away the work the, with my wife, which is nice,
Yeah.
I love her, you know,
I enjoy being with her
Uh-huh.
I guess that's one thing,
but also, uh, that, that long term benefit of a little bit of tone in your muscles.
Right,
that's it,
I do the occasional push up and sit up.
I haven't really brought myself to go to the the gym, because that's very stressful to me,
Yeah.
because I feel, I felt real competitive there,
and I need to find some place I could go and not feel like there's all these people who are just huge and hulking that are ...
Oh, yeah,
I don't, I don't let that bother me,
but, yeah,
that's something that comes with time, too. You know,
Right.
I'll tell you, the sit ups and push ups are excellent you know,
Uh-huh.
it's your own,
you, you're, you're struggling against your own body weight
Right.
you can have variety by putting your feet higher or lower, by putting your arms further apart or closer together, by doing them real quick or real slow
Right.
and you can actually get a good
you can, I know in the push up, at least, you can get chest muscles and the back of your arms quite built up just doing push ups.
Uh-huh.
That's a good idea,
but I do have my ride,
we have a stationary bicycle and a stair step machine here at the house.
Oh, is that right.
I'll do those once in a while just you know, like at eleven thirty when Love Connection's on and I can't sleep,
Right.
Yeah.
Right.
I'll get up and stair step for half an hour
That's funny.
so.
Yeah.
It's, I guess, pretty, pretty healthy,
but I don't have a regular plan, that's
Yeah.
I need to get started on that.
Well, you know, maybe not.
I'd say, I'd say at twenty-two you don't necessarily need a plan as long as you're getting, getting the exercise otherwise.
Right.
When your life becomes sedentary is when you have to make yourself a plan,
Uh-huh.
and what's real funny about plans is that there's a struggle between, uh, when you, when you add something to your life, when you add a plan to your life,
something else has to go away
Uh-huh.
and that's the hard decision, is, okay, if I'm going to run in the mornings, what am I, what do I trade it off for.
Well, the answer's sleep, right.
Sleep
If I'm going to walk at night, what do I trade it off for.
Well, Star Trek
Uh-huh.
or, you know, it, it, it's always trade offs,
and you actually have to, as you get older you have to really think what can go, and what, to, to, to replace this thing.
Yeah.
It's, I mean, not just exercise, but anything.
It's very hard.
Right.
And, uh, I don't, I don't think you should worry about not having a program yet.
That'll come some day when I,
Yep.
Yeah,
I guess if you care, or if your wife, your future wife, uh, gives you a reason to care which helps
Right.
Well, I hope so.
Well, I think we covered it.
Yeah,
sounds good.
Nice talking with you, Craig.
Yeah,
you too.
Have a nice day.
You too.
Good day.
Bye.
Bye.

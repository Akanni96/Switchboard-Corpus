Okay.
All right,
well, I'm not a big exerciser,
but I kind of had to start after I had my baby because I wanted to lose that extra weight.
Uh-huh.
And so basically at this point I'm, I'm a real walker.
I am, too.
Are you?
Yes.
I don't do that, oh, I guess I'll call it that fancy type walking where they kind of move their hips, you know, and keep their arms up.
Uh-huh.
I don't do that.
I mostly just take a, a walk around the block or with my baby
or, you know, and I have to do that at least once a day. If it, If it's going to make any effect on, since I have to eat the same as I did before.
Oh, that's good.
I can't neglect that because of the baby either.
And how old is your baby?
She just, uh, well, she was premature,
so she's about nine months now, though.
times goes fast.
Yes.
Well, I walk two and a half to three miles every night.
Oh, that's great.
My husband and I were on Nutrisystem about eighteen months ago
Uh-huh.
and he lost sixty-two pounds
and I lost twenty-one.
Oh, my goodness.
So we've decided to maintain our weight, that we will do this exercise walking program
and we walk our dog every night and go up around the elementary school.
Uh-huh.
We have a little path that we do. And, uh, except if it's raining or real cold which it hasn't been
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Exactly.
we try to get out, uh, every, every night.
Uh-huh.
And he plays racquetball twice a week,
but I'm not into that,
so I think the walking is enough to help us stay in shape and toned.
Well, I think that is just wonderful.
Now, as far as I'm concerned, I have several other children
and so, uh, I think at this point to fit it into, to other things, it's kind of a task.
Yes.
You know. Uh, it's not to where I'm just so freed up that I, I just go, oh, this is wonderful,
let's go
Right
that's right.
I know my kids are into sports
and a lot of times, tonight we won't finish with the football game till around nine thirty
so we will just go out after that.
Uh-huh.
So, my kids, luckily, are old enough I can leave them at home alone while I go out and walk.
Yeah.
Now, does your husband usually go with you, then?
Yes.
Oh, see, now that's really nice.
Yes.
Because mine's at meetings sometimes
and, and he's not really into it
so I have to,
No
my husband never was either until he lost the weight.
Uh-huh.
That was his decision.
He had arthritis in his hips
and his doctor said he needed to lose weight and exercise.
I think that is so wonderful.
So once he got motivated, now he's ready to walk every night.
And our dog has lost a little weight.
He walks every night, too
So, he gets excited when he sees us put on our, our shoes, our walking shoes.
I bet.
I think that's really, really good.
And, and, you know, I think this, after you've done it a certain amount of time, it kind of does get to be a routine.
Yes.
It's not,
like when I first started, it, you know, that was the hardest thing was to get ready and get out there.
Making time for it.
But now if I haven't done it in a day or two or something, I really notice that I haven't done it in a ...
Yes.
You know. And I like the time because my kids, sometimes they come with me
and sometimes they don't.
And when they don't, I, I really notice, you know, how fun it can be when they come.
So, uh, I like to have somebody come with me.
I know,
I do, too.
Uh, I know most of, enough of the people that if anything ever happened I could go to a home around this block area.
Right.
So it, it's not real dangerous,
but still, I don't like to go alone.
No.
So
I never do either. Even if I have my dog with me.
Yeah.
You know, it's nice to have another person there,
but ...
Yeah.
You know,
Mostly, it's my husband
and sometimes it's my kids.
Well, I think that's great.
I, and, well, sometimes when I, I take my kids to the playground that's the only other exercise I, I really think I do.
I was on an exercise program before where it was more like an aerobics type thing.
Uh-huh.
Uh, I found real quick that wasn't for me.
Me, too.
I did the dance step when I lived up in Michigan
Uh-huh
and it just wore me out.
I would leave totally exhausted.
I never lost any weight,
and I got to the point I dreaded going in.
Yeah,
yeah.
So walking seems to be a good solution for me
and it doesn't cost anything
Right
right.
And it gives me time to think.
So I think, not only does it help my body,
but I think it helps my mind too.
Yes.
So I like that.
That's the one time in the day my husband and I can get away and talk without having the kids jump in and ...
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
need something
and,
Yep.
They can wait until you get back home.
Yep.
Well, I think that's great
Well, that's what I do for
Yep,
that's all I do, too.
Okay.
Okay.

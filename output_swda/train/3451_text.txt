Uh-huh,
I have got two.
One is, uh, two
and the other one's four
and, uh, this is my first year of staying home.
I've always had them in child care.
Oh, well, then you are familiar with it?
Uh-huh.
Okay,
I, uh, I have grandchildren
and I know, uh, one has gone to a, well, two of them have gone to preschool.
Uh-huh.
And I know what the experience my daughter has faced with that.
Why don't you tell me what you have found.
Well, uh, the,
with our second sitter, the first one didn't quite work out, there were some things going on that I wasn't really happy with
and so I felt that, that I need to move on with them
and so I found another baby-sitter
and she was wonderful
except I thought that there were too many in the home
and it just seemed like it was so hard to find, uh, really good child care.
She was wonderful,
it's just that I felt that there were too many in the home.
It was in home child care.
Okay, Okay,
so it was in home child care.
You took them to someone's home?
Uh-huh.
Well, both times?
Uh-huh,
right.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, and then I worked in, in the child care centers
and I wasn't really happy with the particular one that I was working in
so I just always had a fear about, you know, child care centers.
Oh, uh-huh.
And then I just decided that I was just missing a lot of their time whether they were so little
and, and I couldn't get off of work as often as I wanted to when they were ill
so I just decided it was probably best just to stay home for a while until they were a little more, uh, independent
and, uh, I could go back to work.
I know that in raising my children, uh, I was fortunate,
I didn't have to work,
we didn't necessarily have a lot of things
Yeah
That's how it's going now.
But, uh, and, I know my daughter,
because she has three
Uh-huh.
I mean it's so expensive.
Oh, yeah.
You have to really make a lot of money.
Yeah.
And I'm glad that she gets to stay home so that she can then participate with what's going on in their life.
Yeah.
Uh, bosses don't always seem to understand getting off to go to Christmas programs in the middle of the day or something.
Oh, no,
yeah.
You know, and I know that one of the day cares and it's a, a well-known chain, uh, she was not at all happy with.
It was, there was too many children per person.
They were just kind of left to play,
there was no structure to,
and the middle grandson went there as a, uh, like a preschool thing.
Uh-huh.
She was wanting him actually to start getting a certain amount of, of learning and training and stuff.
Not just there, you know,
so he went like, uh, I think he went, well, five mornings a week, if I remember correctly.
Wow.
And, uh, you know, and it was supposed to be a base,
you know, starting to learn the colors and, and learning to associate with children so that when he went to, you know, school and stuff,
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
and, uh, she was most unhappy with it.
Huh.
There was no structure,
there was nothing to it.
You know, and, uh, she pulled him out of that one and put him in a, another one that was excellent.
It was, it was like a little kindergarten.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, they had hot lunches
and, and they had classes that, you know, one class they'd do art.
They even familiarized the children with computers.
Oh.
Uh, it was just, it was really a very excellent one.
Uh-huh.
And how old was he?
He's now five and a half.
He's in kindergarten.
Oh.
This was last year.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, so, you know, it helped him and, and the first one, uh, he went to a, uh, church preschool that was very good.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
The Methodist Church in Richardson.
Oh.
The big one
and it was a excellent,
they,
very good.
My little boy goes to the Methodist, uh, in Garland.
Oh, does he?
Uh-huh.
I'm real happy with that one.
Yeah,
they, uh, the church ones, church ones seem to be very well run.
Well, I've, I've heard that the Methodist ones are excellent.
Oh, really?
Uh-huh.
Even the even the Mother's Day Out programs, I heard, are real good.
Oh. I had, uh, I just assumed that most churches, going by, you know experience there, that, you know, that they were good.
Yeah.
I I didn't know that, uh, you know,
Uh-huh.
I'm not that familiar.
I just know that, you know, First United Methodist of Richardson was just a great program.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
because this is First United Methodist in Garland that he goes to
Uh-huh.
and I'm real happy with that.
Yeah,
it's a pretty good size church, too, isn't it?
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
So, Well, are you enjoying staying home?
Well, that's a,
Yes,
I am
Uh, I taught for Richardson School District
Oh, uh-huh.
and, uh, I taught early childhood
and I really enjoyed it,
but it was just, it was taking a lot of my time
and I noticed I was spending less and less time with them
and it just seemed like they were sick more often
Uh-huh.
and I just couldn't get the time off to,
so,
Well, isn't it very hard to teach young children and then come home and deal with young children. And have enthusiasm.
Yeah,
it is.
It really is.
Yeah,
it really is.
And I felt,

Okay,
Cindy, you there?
Yeah.
Okay,
what kind of dinner parties have you had?
Well, I've had them, uh, where I've served up to twelve to sixteen people.
Uh-huh.
Uh, and I had help with them.
Uh, and part of them I did were like a buffet
Uh-huh.
and, uh, it,
I had, uh, just different, uh, side dishes and appetizers
and one of them that, that I'd remembered was, uh, some, uh, sausage hors d'oeuvres
and, uh, anyhow, uh, you take, uh, a couple of, uh, cups of Bisquick and, uh, sausage, oh, like a, a Owens mild,
Uh-huh.
you can, I guess you could use the hot if you wanted to.
Whatever you like, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah.
And, uh, you put that in
and then you get some real sharp cheddar cheese and put that in and a little bit of milk and make it all doughy
Uh-huh.
and then, like, I just put them in little balls and bake them for about fifteen minutes
Um.
and they are so good.
Oh, that sounds delicious.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's making me hungry for them right now.
Yeah.
You know, I've made like little Swedish meatballs,
but they're just made out of the beef, you know. And, uh, with spices and things in them. But never anything mixed with Bisquick.
Have you?
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
I, I've used that quite a bit
and it, and it seems to work real well.
Uh-huh.
Uh,
Um.
And, uh, uh, when I've had so many people, uh, to feed, like I try to do a ham and a turkey
and and,
Yeah,
that's my, that's my parties mostly is at Christmas time and Thanksgiving time.
Yeah.
You know, I've, uh, I had an open house party here once when, after we moved in here, uh, which I had things like that,
but I always cooked them ahead of time
and then I just sliced them. You know, and had macaroni salad with, uh, shrimp in it.
Uh-huh.
Have you ever had that?
No.
What,
Put some fresh, little fresh shrimp
and it's, in your macaroni salad that you make.
Uh-huh.
The shrimp just gives it a really good flavor.
Oh, I'll bet.
Yeah,
I don't like the can, but the fresh.
Yeah.
You know.
I'll have to try that.
Yeah,
that was really good.
I like things that are easy and, and, uh, nutritious.
Yeah,
right,
right.
But, uh, at, uh, Christmas time we just have a regular sit down dinner, you know. Which is kind of hard because you got so many people
Uh-huh.
and then by time you pass everything around,
it seems like everything on your plate's cold.
I know.
I know
So,
Well,
But anyhow, I,
Thank God for microwaves, you know.
Yeah,
you can, always take your plate and just heat it up, you know.
Yeah.
But, uh, other than that, I, I don't have too many parties.
Uh, you know, I have, like, maybe just a another couple over for dinner.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
But, uh, other than, than, than that I don't have, you know a whole bunch of people like except, except at Christmas
Yeah.
and I have my family.
Right,
well I don't anymore.
it's been a few years
and, and, uh, I don't have, you know, over a couple either
and and, uh, I try to, uh, have everything all ready
Uh-huh.
and, and it, it just makes it a lot nicer where a don't spend all my time in the kitchen.
Yeah,
right.
And, uh, Spaghetti
Right.
and,
Yeah,
that's easy.
I always like to have that, too.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Everybody seems to like that, too.
I know,
I don't think I've ever met anyone that didn't.
No,
everybody likes that.
Yeah.
And, then, uh, if you have a nice big roast that you can throw in the oven, then you can put your potatoes and carrots or whatever else all in there, you know. Especially if a pork roast.
Oh, yeah.
That's what I love, with my
I like it, too.
I do, too.
And, uh, other than that, in fact, I'm just thinking of what next weekend when the Super Bowl's on
Uh-huh.
I've asked a couple people to come over
and I just, uh, had been thinking what to have for that
Yeah.
Well, have you had any good ideas yet?
No
not yet
Oh, okay.
No,
and I, you know, I don't want to have to come away from the T V.
I want something that I can just take them and serve them while they're sitting in front of the T V.
Yeah.
You know, so, I'll think of something, just that we can munch on over there, you know.
Yeah.
And they can just fill their plate up at intermission and then go back over there and sit down.
And that's the way to do it, too.
Yeah,
yeah.
I think it's, you know what's I think is so nice is that in this day and time that we can have good food that's good for you
and you don't have to spend hours and hours and hours in the kitchen.
Yeah.
And, And it makes an awful lot of difference, doesn't it?
Preparing it,
right.
Oh, it sure does.
Well,
Well, when I was brought up, you know, we didn't,

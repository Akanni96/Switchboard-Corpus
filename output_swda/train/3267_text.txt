Wondering how you keep up on the news.
Primarily with our local newspaper and T V.
Uh-huh.
I listen to the radio but not, um, not like I did when I was working.
I am recently retired
to that means I have a lot of time to watch the news on T V.
How do you gain your news?
I guess the, I get the WASHINGTON POST
Okay.
and that is a pretty big newspaper
and I think that's almost exclusive me, my first of the news.
Though I have the radio on when I go to work, I don't think the news usually hits,
because I'm not going right on the hour.
Oh, I see.
You know.
Well, that's, that is one of the handicaps with both T V and, and radio.
If you're not available on the hour or half hour, then you lose out on an awful lot.
Well, what is your newspaper?
That is the WASHINGTON POST
Right.
is that correct?
I have read that when we were in that area,
and it is a splendid newspaper.
Uh-huh.
So, what more do we need to discuss tonight?
That seems like a very short one.
Right.
I think that, you know, we, we've resolved the issue
and that's what we were asked to do.
Well, I can discuss a lot of the news that we have,
but, uh, I feel that that's not part of our responsibility.
Right.
Right.
So thank you for calling.
Oh, okay.
Well, thanks for discussing it.
All right.
Bye-bye.
Good-bye.

So, who's your favorite team?
My favorite team is the Pittsburgh Steelers.
Pittsburgh?
You bet.
I used  to be a big Pittsburgh fan when I was little.
Well, I, uh,
when played he was from my hometown in Alabama,
Oh, really?
so I  kind of grabbed on to that team,  way back when.
Huh.
pretty
that's good.
I, I used to watch them a lot when they were playing the big iron curtain,  or steel curtain.
That's right.
How about your favorite team?
Huh.
Well, last year it was Buffalo
and I, I still try to keep up with Buffalo because they just, they just impressed me as being so efficient
and they never score.
They never blow out their opponents.
They just score just enough points,
Uh-huh.
and that really  impressed me.
But then down here I
is pretty close to New Orleans
and I've been keeping up with the Saints a lot.
Well, they are exciting, aren't they?
Yeah,
the Saints are starting to impress me this year, you know, a lot.
Boy,
they are, they are just a fun team to watch.
This, it, they are really.
Did you see the game Sunday night or,  Sunday  afternoon?
Uh,  no,
I didn't.
It was funny.
There were, they uh, a fireworks display at halftime.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah,
and some paper or something in the Super Dome up in the roof caught on fire.
Oh,  you're kidding
So, they had  to stop the game lieu the third quarter and put out this fire.
Oh, my
Those big piece of something came flaming, falling out of the roof and landed on the field
so there's this big fire on the field
and they were dumping the bucket and everything.
Oh, I can't  believe that.
It was
I mean,  you just really can't tell what's going to happen.
That's hilarious.
I know.
It's like about two weeks ago I was watching the Saints.
Uh-huh.
And Anderson kicked a sixty yard field goal.
Oh.
And it, it was beautiful, right down the middle.
Oh, boy.
He is tough,
he has an incredible leg.
He is.
Yes.
Well, do you think they're, they're going to be able to make it this year,  past the first  playoff game?
Uh I  I sure hope so.
I'm not sure, I'm not sure who they play.
Right now I've got it narrowed down to the top four teams.
Who's that?
It's pretty much going between Washington. They are undefeated. And, uh, Buffalo, New Orleans, and Chicago because Chicago has only lost twice
Right.
and one of those was to Buffalo.
And they beat the Saints.
Their only time they lost.
What do you think about, uh, Houston?
Houston.
I saw Houston play this summer in Memphis.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Uh, from what I saw they were playing,
when I was at the game we sat right on the front row,  right  behind the Houston Oilers,
Huh.
and from what I saw the game Houston, Houston impressed me a lot.
Huh.
But my  brother watched it on T V and said that Warren Moon was just having an off night,
and if that was an off night I'd hate to see when he's on a good night.
Oh, yeah,
he's he definitely, uh, is one of the best I think.
He's,
Yeah,
the, their, their backfield is really impressive.
Haywood and Drew Hill and
Right.
they really impress me.
Well, they squeaked out a game on Sunday.
That's right.
Who, who did they play?
They played Dallas.
Dallas,
that's right,
They won,  in overtime.
all because,
That's right.
I remember that now.
So that was,
I, I watched that game
and, uh, that was, uh,
Do you have a favorite between those two?
Well, because I'm right here in Dallas I, I kind of pull for Dallas.
Really?
Yeah.
Well, also Houston is, uh, in Pittsburgh's division
so,  I'll almost always  root against them.
Well, that's true.
I hate to say it
but I hate Dallas
That's okay
Well I, you know, I, I was never really a big Dallas fan until we moved here
Yeah.
and they just kind of grew on me.
Yeah,
I imagine.
That's the way,
I've never been a big Saints fan until the last year or two
and they, they've actually started doing something.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So, I've actually paid attention to them.
Well
Well, do you know anything about the expansion teams they're thinking about bringing in?
To tell you the truth I haven't paid too much attention to that.
Really?
Um, what cities are they looking at?
Uh, right now I think this Memphis, they're, they're trying to get the  teams.
Uh-huh.
And that's, that's where I was when I saw, uh,  Houston  play.
Uh-huh.
Saint Louis is trying to get a team.
Uh, Baltimore is trying to get a team,
and there's some other city.
I'm wanting to say Raleigh
but I'm not sure.
You know, I think you are right.
I think it is Raleigh.
Think so?
I think I remember hearing that.
Uh-huh.
Because I know they've got a football team
but I think it might be them.
That would be fun.
I'd like to see some more teams get in.
I would, definitely.
I think they are supposed to put two in by either next year or the year after.
And right now I think Memphis and, it's Memphis and I think Baltimore have a really good shot at it.
Uh-huh.
Because I know Saint Louis is much bigger than Memphis
and when I went up there they were saying that Memphis sold more tickets than Saint Louis did.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
It's like the Liberty Bowl or Liberty Stadium in Memphis holds about sixty-two,

What kind of movies have you been seeing lately?
Uh, it's been probably a month or so since I've been to the movies.
Course, my, my favorite now is, is DANCES WITH WOLVES.
Oh, it's an excellent movie.
Uh, SILENCE OF THE uh, of the LAMBS was good.
SILENCE OF THE LAMBS?
Uh-huh.
What was that anyway?
Oh, it's a, I guess it's a mystery, you'd call it.
It's with, uh, Jodie Foster.
Okay.
And it, uh, it's pretty good.
Another one that I think I really liked was, uh, THE FISHER KING.
Uh-huh.
Let's see,
who was in FISHER KING?
That was, um, Robin Williams
and, uh and, uh, I can't the last name.
Right.
How about you?
What are you?
Uh, we've not been having many opportunities to see movies lately.
Um, we really enjoyed, um, DEAD POETS' SOCIETY.
Yes.
Um, several years back one we saw, we saw we really, really enjoyed was, uh, ORDINARY PEOPLE, with, uh, Timothy Hutton and, uh, Mary Tyler Moore,
and, uh, uh, who played the father, anyway
Right.
excellent movie.
That was, that was an excellent movie.
Have you seen DANCES WITH WOLVES?
Yes
we have.
What'd you think of it?
Oh, we loved it.
I don't think I can see it enough times.
I know what you mean.
I know what you mean.
Course I'm a Kevin Costner fan.
Yeah,
I'm pretty impressed with stuff he's done.
Uh, he made kind of an odd sounding ROBIN HOOD,
but, uh, I mean, you know, basic thick western U S accent for a ROBIN HOOD just doesn't seem to fit.
No,
but you know, it wasn't a bad movie.
Oh, no.
It's a good movie.
It got such bad reviews,
really, and, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
But I, then I wasn't expecting any classic either.
Well, um, they did a real good job with it.
I thought so.
Um, they didn't try to make him super human or, you know, invincible.
They just, just,
he worked hard at it.
Have you seen THE FISHER KING?
No
I haven't, not an opportunity to see that, uh,
Uh, it,
you, you know,
I guess it, it really isn't for everybody.
It's, it's pretty deep and, uh, uh, philosophical.
Yeah.
But I thought it had a wonderful message to it. It's the kind you came out and looked at somebody and said, You know, I think I liked that
Yeah.
And then the more you got to thinking about it, the more you thought, You know, I did like it
Yeah.
But when you first came out, you weren't real sure.
It sounds kind of like one, uh, we saw at home here on the, rented it, um, CLARA'S HEART.
Haven't seen that.
Um, Whoopi Goldberg.
Oh, yes,
I did,
yes,
I did.
And she played a, uh,
the, uh,
she's a housekeeper.
Uh, the nanny type.
Yeah,
she's a housekeeper
she. She was a, oh, now I can't say it, a Haitian.
Housekeeper, uh-huh.
Anyway, she, uh, she seemed to be that sort of person that seems half crazy,
but then again, she's got a whole lot on the ball,
and the movie had the whole, lot of philosophical content, more than, more than, you know,
it wasn't a mystery,
it wasn't, you know, blood and guts and violence and, and car chases type thing.
It was just a good movie.
I saw one the other day that was A KISS BEFORE DYING.
A KISS BEFORE DYING.
Uh-huh.
I had not heard about it when it was on the movies, but was out on video.
And.
And it's with Sean Young.
Yeah.
And it's a, it's a mystery.
It was very predictable,
I mean, you knew, you knew when the murder was going to happen or something,
but it was still so well done that it was enjoyable.
Yeah.
That, that takes a good bit to make one that's predictable that's still worth watching.
That's right.
I had, uh, uh,
I like the, I think it's called the, uh, RAZOR'S EDGE,
but, no
no,
the JAGGED EDGE,
the JAGGED EDGE  with, uh,
Oh, okay  .

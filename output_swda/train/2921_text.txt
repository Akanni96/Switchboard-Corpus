What part of the country are you in?
Uh, Pennsylvania.
Yeah.
Oh, you are?
East or west, I'm from Pittsburgh. *listen
Oh, are you really?
Yeah.
What part of Pittsburgh?
Um, the South Hills area, Beaver County, well originally Beaver County .
Uh-huh.
And, uh, where are you from?
Uh, Clarion County.
Oh, okay,
I know where that is.
I we live out in the country.
Yeah,
that's pretty out there.
What, well,
Yeah,
we have, we have two children that live in Pittsburgh
Oh, okay,
yeah,
I got my brother and my whole family there.
I'm, I'm talking to you from Dallas right now.
Oh, oh, you are?
Uh-huh
Do you work, do you work for Texas Instruments then?
No,
my husband does.
Oh, uh-huh.
And who, how about you?
No,
I'm just, Uh, federal company, you know,
place that, that needed this. *listen--not sure who's saying what
so, yeah.
Well that's okay.
I guess it's an easy thing to do.
So you're you have a big,
do you have a rural house or what do you have?
Uh, we have a big old farmhouse that we've you know, remodeled.
Oh, that's a,
Those are beautiful.
It had been, you know, of course, a farm.
Uh-huh.
It's a farm community,
and we.
Yeah,
is it a, is it a working farm
or is it?
Ours is not a working farm
More, more,
I can understand that,
that's probably what I would, uh,
Yeah,
I have a garden
but you know,
we have a garden.
Yeah
But we don't farm.
I can hear the accent now
I hear the I hear the Western Pennsylvania, um.
Uh-huh.
We live, uh, we lived in Minneapolis for about five years.
Uh-huh.
We, we originally lived in Dallas
and we met and got married
Uh-huh.
and then, um, actually married in Pittsburgh,
and that's, that's not what they want to hear on this call, uh
Uh-huh.
at any rate we came back here with,
my husband was transferred around, uh, up to Minnesota and now back to Texas with T I
Uh-huh.
and we're leasing a, uh, two story town home in a section of Dallas they call North Dallas.
Oh, uh-huh.
And it's, uh, near a little town called Plano,
well, it's not little any more.
Uh, Grapevine,
do you know Grapevine?
Uh, yes,
that's out near the airport.
That's about forty-five miles from us.
Yeah,
my brother has a home there he's trying to sell.
He, he's living now up, uh, in, in Maryland
but, uh, he, lived in Grapevine for a long time.
It's,
yeah,
That's why we not sure, we, we're not sure we want to, uh, buy down here, because we actually, we lived up north long enough to appreciate the, um, *listen--one utt?
Minneapolis-Saint Paul is very clean
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
you know, in terms of, *listen; with previous slash unit?
and in terms of housing down here, um, you really have your pick
but it's just everything's overpriced for the economy.
Oh, it's terrible.
I,
It really is,
I mean we're, we're in a leased town home,
and it's, uh, you're probably, your teeth will probably fall out figuratively speaking, it's nine hundred a month.
Oh, I'm not surprised.
But, you know what,
if you, if you get anything under five hundred you get into what they call high density living you know, the big apartment complexes
Uh, right,
right.
Right,
right.
and, and I just have no tolerance for that.
Yeah,
yeah,
it's not good
No.
And the people think the income is really great in some of those areas
but when they sit down and look at what it costs to live
and, uh, of course, most of the homes are, you know, fairly nice,
they're, uh, done up fairly nice, uh,
Yeah
this is, it's like a duplex,
like a two by two they call it like in Pittsburgh.
Right,
uh-huh, Uh-huh.
And it's nice
but it's, I mean, the girl bought it for a hundred and ten,
and now she can't sell it.
And our neighbors,
Well, prices have come down on the homes, the duplexes.
Yeah,
I mean, we'll, our neighbors, the attached on the other side, they're very nice, thank God,
Uh-huh.
they paid fifty-eight for it.
Oh, my heaven.
That's how bad it,
I know.
Well, I know up in Connecticut the same thing happened, people are devastated because they paid so much for their home.
That's right.
Uh-huh,
yeah.
I have some friends that live in Westport
and it's really, really bad.
I mean you,
But we like our area.
It, like I said, it's, it's an old house and everything
Uh-huh.
but, uh,
How far, where is Clarion County in relation to, actually,
because we're considering moving to Pennsylvania
Well, we're about a hundred miles from Pittsburgh north.
That's not too bad.
That's north.
And yeah,
and it's, it's really not, you know, not that far.
Are you going up toward, uh, uh,
I'm trying to think of the name of that town that starts with an M,
Bradford, no that's too far north.
Bradford's north of us.
So you're, you're not that far north then,
okay.
No,
no.
Well, you're really not too bad.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Um, was it a home that you've had for quite a few years,
or that you've,
Well, we've been here since sixty-six.
Oh, then you have,
yeah.
Do you have a lot of land
or,
Uh, we have fifty acres.
Oh, my,
well, then.
Oh, pardon me,
we have forty,
we gave ten to one of our children
There you go.
Did you have a hard time getting used to,
do you feel like you live in an isolated area
or,
No,
not really,
and, and towns keep creeping closer and closer, you know.
Yeah,
I think that that's, um,
I can remember in Pittsburgh when,
this has to do with homes, uh, indirectly
but I can remember when Upper Saint Clair was out in the, you know, the rural end of Washington,
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
and now it's it's a terrible connection.
Yeah,
it's ours up here.
We have,
our rural connections are real bad
Oh, well that's okay, um,
But we, but we live about ten miles from probably three or four, not large towns but, you know, reasonable.
But, but,
yeah,
substantially, you know.
Um, do you like living in an older home and restoring it like that?
Uh, yeah,
we're tired of doing it though.
We, we don't want to do too much more
How big is it?
How many square feet do you have?
Uh, oh, golly,
I really.
Well how many rooms do you think,
yeah?
We have, uh, uh, four rooms downstairs, and a pantry
Uh-huh.
and upstairs we have a bath, a bath, oh
we, have a half bath downstairs, too.
Uh-huh.
We have a bath upstairs, and one, two, three, four bedrooms and a sewing room and a junk room
And, uh,
A junk room,
yeah
I understand,
we have that too.
That's, that's large if your children aren't at home any more.
Pardon?
That's large if your kids aren't at home any more.
Well, it really isn't too big yet.
We, we
a lot of people say that
but, um, it's,
Uh-huh.
we just like it real well Yeah,
It's enough space for two people
Yeah.
we had five children,
so and they've all moved you know, on.
Oh, okay.
They're all out on their own now.
Yeah,
right.
That's okay.
Well, we've got, um,
this town house is pretty big.
It's about eighteen hundred square feet.
It's got three bedrooms, two and a half baths
Uh-huh.
um, it's really nice.
Well, it sounds like a good buy.
Yeah,
it is,
I mean, I would never buy it
but leasing it is fine.
Uh-huh.
Um, but, it's just again, the, the privacy, you know.
Um, we had a house in Minneapolis that was on three acres,
and my husband was raised, um, on a working farm near
Oh, that makes a big difference.
right,
near Dayton, Ohio,
and he said, you know,
he's, he's slowly getting me to, um, not feel isolated if we move to where there's more land.
Uh-huh.
You really aren't isolated because it's,
the advantages,
your home is far enough away that you're not bothered by being too close to people,
Right.
but yet you can have your friends, uh,
you can have them in,
you can go out.
Uh-huh.
You have more of a choice,
you're not pressed upon as bad.
That's kind of what, like
his parents have, uh, land that they retired to, um, about a hundred miles out of Atlanta and, in Georgia,
Uh-huh.
and it is too far south for me,
Uh, uh-huh. Uh-huh.
but, um, um, but I mean, they have one of the, um,
when they said log cabin, I just laughed,
that they retired to,
but they built one of these.
I mean, it's just beautiful.
It's like a custom, you know
it's not like what I would think of when I think of old log cabins.
You know, I mean, it's modern
it's,
More luxury.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
Right,
right,
it's modern,
it's beautiful,
it's country
Right,
yeah.
it's you know, um,
but, uh, I don't,
what else about housing except it's, uh, well,
Pittsburgh's housing economy, I think it's holding it's own.
Uh, they're,
yeah,
I suppose they are now.
We,
both of our children who live there have just bought a home. Uh, in the Mount Lebanon area.
What part, what sections are they in?
Yeah,
that's nice.
And, uh, the one, the one boy, the house they bought is completely livable.
They didn't have to do much to it.
Great.
The other one is, uh, uh, has, you know, needs more work done.
It's twenty years old, I think.
Uh-huh.
And, but they have two children, too,
and they, they bought what they could afford.
Uh-huh.
That's,
yeah,
a really good friend of mine lives in Penn Hills,
and they've been in their house, oh, probably about twelve years now
Uh-huh.
and, um, it's, it's, you know,
they're going to start to see their return on their investment very soon.
Uh-huh.
Um, but it's a beautiful home
and, I mean, my brother lives,
They are beautiful homes.
is it called Baldwin or Bebble?
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
I mean, he lives all in that same area going from Mount Lebanon, um,
it's real pretty up there.
It's just,
It is,
it's real nice.
And the neighborhoods are stable you know.
Uh-huh.
It's, uh,
when you come to this part of the country, we've been away from Dallas long enough that you see the difference in housing.
Oh, my
you you do when you
When we first got married, uh,
my husband works for the state,
and we moved once a year usually
Oh, my goodness.
And then after they had to start paying to move us, that suddenly wasn't necessary any more
Uh-huh.
That's what it is here,
yeah,
that's why we're at a point now we've, uh, we're adopting
and we have been married ten plus years
and what happens is, uh, you just realize that once you get to a certain age the next house that you get we'll be staying in Yeah,
Right, yeah,
you have to stop some place,
yeah.
that's kind of like where we're,
Yeah.
so we're considering Pennsylvania,
and we're just kind of, you know, toying with what exactly, where we want to be, you know.
Uh-huh. I do too,
A lot of people say it doesn't matter where they live if they have a nice house
and, but I disagree with that,
I.
I've heard too many people say, I hate it here.
Uh-huh.
You know, they buy a place
and they just hate the area.
I know,
and it, and the economy here in Dallas, I mean, it, it's steady,
but it's still not going up.
Uh-huh.
And I, um, I just refuse to buy it, um, if I know I'm not going to be there for at least five years, uh, you, you know.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
well, my brother, they're having trouble selling their home, see.
Oh, I'm sure,
yeah,
there, I mean, you can go down a street,
and here, he told you this, every other house, you know, if it's been foreclosed on or, you know, even big executives
Right,
uh-huh.
Oh, yeah,
yeah.
um, it's really, I mean,
and, and it's hard to sell the properties.
People from J C Penney's from New York, came here about a couple of years ago.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
And they thought they were getting a great deal, um, because they could get a five hundred thousand dollar home with, they call it, zero lot lines, no property, And it would make you ill to see this.
Oh, uh-huh.
Yeah.
I mean it would probably be like your house on, uh, you know, a half a city block in Pittsburgh or something.
I, I couldn't handle that
Yeah,
I know,
and that's, you know, like
I can look outside right now and look into the next unit.
Uh-huh.
You know, it's across the way,
and it's landscaped and all that with azaleas,
Uh-huh.
but it's still, it's still not that private.
I get tired, uh, sometimes, mowing, because we mow, you know, a good bit of ground around the house area.
Yeah
but you have a rider.
And I do get tired of that
but, uh, I don't know,
I don't think I'd want to change it.
No,
and your kids have,
to tell you the truth, um, I think that if you can keep that, that way, you know, kind of like a homestead,

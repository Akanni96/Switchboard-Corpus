All right,
so, we started recording already?
Uh, I guess,
I don't know.
It's the first time I've made a phone call on it.
Oh, so you pressed one?
Right.
Okay.
So, I guess we're supposed to start talking.
Uh what kind of books do you read?
I read, uh, a lot of Steven King, Dean R Koontz, uh some Danielle Steel.
Uh-huh.
My aunt got me hooked on those
Uh-huh.
So I,
So it's mostly all novels?
Yeah,
they're all novels.
Okay.
I'll read some, uh, classic, too.
Oh, like what?
Uh, like THE GRADUATE by Steinbeck.
I'll, uh,
Yeah,
I like that.
I like Steinbeck a lot.
A, A ROSE FAMILY by Faulkner. That's one of my favorites.
I have never read a lot of Faulkner.
Oh, and this, this is more of a play or something that, that it was from, that, that I saw
and I read the book from that.
Oh, cool
And, by the way, my name's Bill.
I'm from North Carolina
I'm Doug,
I'm from Pennsylvania.
Uh, I,
let's see.
What kind of books do you like to read?
Uh, well, a bunch of stuff, I guess, uh, fair number of novels, but mostly shorter ones.
And, like, I don't really like the, you know, six hundred page long Stephen King novels and all that.
I really have to be in the mood.
Right?
I, I read one, like maybe once a year.
Uh-huh.
I'm not as,
No,
like, I like, say, uh, Richard Broudigan a lot. Uh,
I've never read anything by him.
Okay.
He's, uh, he's dead now,
but he was really a pretty amazing writer.
He wrote books that were, like, pretty short and pretty easy to read, you know, like written at a third grade level or whatever.
Yeah.
But they were still very heavy and philosophical, also very funny.
Like, He wrote TROUT FISHING IN AMERICA.
Okay.
So that's, anyway,
and, uh, I read a lot of non fiction books, too.
Uh, let's see,
I like to read a lot of non fiction history when Civil War era and, and that kind of thing.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
I found that real interesting.
I'm reading THE LION AND THE WIND right now.
And that was on T V.
Now what's that?
It was, uh, during Teddy Roosevelt's time. And, uh, about a American woman that got kidnapped in, uh, Morocco.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Uh, this is when they were having their revolution or whatever
Uh-huh.
and Teddy Roosevelt sent troops over and really portrays him as a, kind of a crazy man, you know.
Yeah
Surprised me.
I had no idea that he was like that.
Uh-huh.
What, how crazy?
Well, just like some, one quote that he had was that he thought the America's emblem was stupid because it was an eagle,
and it should be a grizzly bear because
Oh,
you, you know, like the grizzly and stuff like that.
So it's,
I saw the movie
and that's what made me want to read the book.
Uh-huh.
Candice Bergen was in the movie.
I'm a real big fan of hers
so,
Yeah.
Cool,
see, I also read a lot of books about music because I'm interested in that and fair number of stuff about science and also philosophy things.
Uh-huh.
I like, I like to read some of the philosophy stuff.
Like,
Uh-huh.
Like, let's see,
and even like reading some new age things, things that I don't quite believe in,
like here on my shelf I have a book called JOURNEYS OUT OF THE BODY.
Yeah,
I think that,
It's all about how to have out of body experiences and all that.
I'm fascinated by that.
Yeah,
I'm fascinated by that.
Uh-huh,
yep.
That,
and, and, uh, even stuff about, not like ghost stories, but real encounters with ghosts and supposedly haunted houses.
Uh-huh.
I like,
I'm kind of a doubting Thomas
and I like to read stuff like that.
Some of it really freaks me out
Yeah.
Uh-huh
Right,
definitely
Uh,
And I like to read, uh, I like to read some self help books like, uh,
I read DIANETICS once, once I got past all the gibberish on it.
Uh, did you like it?
It was okay.
It, it, it, it took me a while to really get into it.
It, it didn't help me that much
Uh-huh.
I see.
But, uh, I think once you're set in your ways, you're set in your ways.
Yeah
Uh, then I,
one real interesting book I read recently was, when I was looking for a job,
I read, HOW TO GET THE JOB THAT YOU WANTED
and, it, it had real good tips
and it,
and I got the job that I wanted by applying the, the methods that, that,
Uh-huh.

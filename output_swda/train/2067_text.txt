Well, um, with credit cards is, me, I, uh, I try to get maybe just one or two,
I don't, I don't like having credit cards for every store.
I, I, uh, I just don't like them
What are you afraid of with them?
What am I afraid of?
Yes.
Um, I don't know if I'm really afraid of spending too much.
I just, uh, don't think that I need them, you know.
I,
uh, they are tempting at times,
but I, I just, you know, sometimes I just don't like everybody knowing everything about me, you know,
so,
Well, that's very, can be very, very true.
So, and you know, everybody just gives you a credit card just so you'll spend money
so,
Well, that's the idea.
They figure that, if they give you card, at no charge for a whole year that you will use it
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
and,
That's right.
See they make money off of it, whether you use it or not.
Absolutely.
Well, the other thing, of course, is the fact that they hope, you will not pay your bill at the end of the month,  so that you  would be paying interest.
That's right.
Uh-huh.
I use mine a great deal, um, for groceries, for everything that I can and, then just write one check at the end of the month,  for the entire thing,
Uh-huh.
That's what I do.
right.
That's what I do.
Just a second. to child in
Sorry
That's all right.
Sounds like you have a little one there.
I have two little ones.
Yes.
Oh, you have.
Yeah.
So
Great.
How old are they?
um, four and two and half.
Oh, boy. Those are two very active ages
Yes.
So, yeah,
um, I'm, I'm like you
I, I use my, only use my credit card for, um, you know, when I, you know,
I just use it whenever I feel like I don't want to write a check,
and then, but I don't charge anything that I can't payoff at the end of the month.
Uh-huh.
So,
Well, uh, do you, uh, do you ever use the A T M machines?
No,
I never do.
My husband does at work just to get cash out,
but, uh, I take the checkbook
so I, you know, I, just, if I need cash, I just tell him
and he gets it out
and I don't even think I know my number
Well, I find it a great use from the standpoint that you don't have to continue to write checks, in order to get cash.
Uh-huh.
That's right.
See we, he couldn't do without it, but, you know, since he can just do it right there at work,  for nothing  .
Oh, that helps.
Right.
Yeah.
Well the, the other thing some people are not aware of, is they will use their A, their credit card like their Visa or their MasterCard for cash
Uh-huh.
and when they do that, they begin paying interest right from that very day on.
You're right.
And that's kind of silly.
Yeah right.
Absolutely.
Yeah.
Because they, they figure that, that's correct
You're defeating the purpose.
The idea is to use their money
Yeah.
And, uh, during that whole month and, then pay it at the end of the month.
Yeah.
Yeah,
I mean, I get, I get at least one or two a week. People, you know, sending me a credit card or calling me on the phone and I just say I don't want it.
Uh-huh.
Right.
Because I,
Well, I think that's the only thing you can do, is just say no and mean no and,  not be tempted.
Yeah.
It's like,  I'd like to know where they determine that I'm such a good credit risk that they can go and say, you get this much credit line. You know.
Well,
You've already been preapproved.
oh, absolutely,
preapproved.
That's their favorite word.
Yes.
Everybody in the country is preapproved, I think.
I think so, you're right.
So,
Well, it's interesting, uh, that, uh, people have the, generally the same view. of credit cards, no matter where you go.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
And, then, some people they get so wrapped up in them that they find, you know, one day they find, wow, I didn't realize I had this much, you know, I'd spent this much money.
That much stuff.
Right.
And, then they can't meet the minimum monthly payments on it.
Well, and some people use one credit card to pay for another credit card they own,
Uh-huh.
and, I mean, that does nothing, but exacerbate the entire problem.
Yeah,
it does because you're, you know, you, you're, you know, you're just costing yourself more money because you, if you can't make the monthly, the minimum payment, you're paying interest, again
That's right.
so,
That's right.
Yeah
so,
Well it's been enjoyable talking with you.
Yeah.
It's enjoyable talking with, seeing that somebody feels the same way,
so, well,
Right.
Well take good care.
Take care of your little ones.
You, you too.
Good luck.
Uh-huh.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.

Do you play?
Yeah,
I, uh, consider myself a hacker.
How about you?
Well, I'm into it. Uh,
Yeah,
uh, I'm not as good as I'd like to be
but it's a,
Is anybody?
No
I don't think so.
Uh, I'd started playing when I was in elementary school actually.
We lived  really close to a par three golf course.
Really?
And I'd go up there with friends after school a couple of times every week
and then for, uh, for years, I don't know, after elementary school, all through junior high and stuff, I didn't play cause I think I just got so frustrated when I was little I'd, my body wasn't, you  know  physically developed and all that kind of stuff
Oh, wow.
Right.
and then I'd started picking it up again a couple of years back
and I've really been enjoying it.
Super.
Yeah,
that's kind of the way I did it too actually.
I, I played, uh, just a tiny bit when I was real young
and then, uh, I I got on to a team in high school but wasn't very good still. But, and then quit for awhile
Uh-huh.
and recently I picked it up, like you say, about a couple of years ago
and, uh, I've been playing, you know, off and on when I can.
Right.
Up in Minneapolis it's not too easy to play in the winter  of course
Uh-huh.
but I actually live in Florida
so, uh uh, I'll be going back down there in May and hopefully be picking it up a little more regularly.
Uh-huh.
Right.
the one factor that really bothers me is the expense of  playing golf.
I was going  to say
I mean it's a great game
but I mean to play a really nice course, you've got to have a really big wallet  I mean.
Yeah,
that's, that's  true, all too many times.
Yeah.
Fortunately, uh, down where I live in Florida, there's some golf courses that are pretty reasonable if you know where to look.
Uh-huh.
Uh, one of them is the University of Florida golf course which is open to the public
Right.
and that's pretty, pretty good.
Yeah.
I, uh, attend the Indiana University
and it's the same way here.
They have a really nice championship style course that is fairly reasonable to play on.
Yeah.
Can you get like a, a student discount type of thing
or,
Uh, a  little bit but not a whole lot.
I mean I, you'd think you would
but, uh, you don't
so. I,
Yeah.
What, what,  what are green fees run there?
Uh, well they range anywhere from about five bucks for your basic city type course up to fifty, sixty dollars for a really, really nice course.
Okay.
That's,
yeah,
that's about the same I guess as it is in Florida.
But,
Uh-huh.
My dad is a member of a golf club over in my home town
and I can play for free there
and it's a pretty nice  course.
Really.
Oh, that's super.
Yeah.
And I guess , well it's free for me
Yeah,
uh-huh.
Somebody's paying
but not me.
Well, that's the way to do it though.
Yeah
That's the way to get in some good practice without having to pay for it all the time
Yeah,
definitely.
As far as watching golf, I mean, I can watch it on T V
but it's kind of boring.
Yeah.
It's nice to see those who , guys.
They have such good style that, uh it's, uh, it's pretty fun to watch.
Yeah.
They need to get a new photography method.
Because once the guy hits the ball and they got to try to follow the ball  that's,  that's a little difficult.
Right.
Yeah.
I mean, it, they do, they do a generally okay job
but like you said, it's, it's kind of boring  actually.
Uh-huh.
What I really,
I, uh, had a chance,
they had the P G A tournament up in Indianapolis last year
Oh, yeah?
and I was able to go and see one of the rounds of that
and that was really fun.
I mean you knew it
Yeah.
I bet that would be .
I never really thought it was, would be that much fun to go to a big golf tournament and watch
but, man, it was, it was something else just to follow those guys around and actually watch them play.
Yeah.
Yeah,
I've never been to a tournament.
Uh, you know, looking at it on T V, you're thinking, man, what a boring thing,  you know.
Right.
But, uh, that's, that's wild though.
I'll have to see if I can't get a  chance  to go,
You got
I mean it's, uh, it's a lot more exciting than actually than watching it on T V.
And if you pick a group of golfers and follow them around, I mean, it's just, watching them the whole time instead of like on T V, you get to see them make a tee shot
Right.
and then they go off to some other hole
and they come back when they're putting,
but, you know, it's really something else.
Yeah,
I can imagine.
What do you do for a living?
Uh, I'm a student right now.
Oh, you are?
Yeah.
Which, uh, which university?
At, uh, Indiana University.
Okay.
All right, great.
What are you going into?
Uh, I don't really know.
I'm a math computer science major right now.
Okay.
Definitely not golf, right
No
I
it'd be nice to be a pro golfer.
I mean, it seems like that, that would be an okay life  just to hang out
and,
Yeah.
If you're good,  you can really rake in the bucks.
what was  what was that movie that they had out?
Yeah.
there was a movie about a professional golfer
and  I, I  can't remember.
Huh.
It was on network T V a couple of times.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Well, you know, it seems like, well you go to work every weekend. Play, maybe, one, two tournaments a month.  You come in about tenth, you'd still  be doing pretty well.
That's right. .
So.
Yeah,
that's a good thing.
Yeah.
But, uh, yeah.
I guess when I get back, I'm going to school in Florida actually.
Uh, and, fortunately, I've been able to, to play some golf on a student budget which is real helpful, you know.
Uh-huh.
But, it, it's unfortunate, you know.
You hear about Japan. I guess, you know, it's, it's like two hundred fifty dollar minimum or three hundred dollar minimum just to, like to practice even .
Right
Yeah.
And those fees to join a club.
Like a million dollars or whatever is just
Yeah.
that is out of control.
I mean you'd really want to really be liking your golf.
Yeah.
I guess they have those, uh, driving ranges that are actually stacked one on top of  the other.
Yeah
I saw one of those on T V.
That is pretty  wild.
.  Yeah.
Yeah,
I, I played, uh, uh, eighteen holes with some Japanese guys in, in Gainesville, as a matter of fact.
And it was really wild.
They were into it.
Yeah.
You know, they kicked our butt all the way to,

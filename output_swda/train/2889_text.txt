or Okay,
what kind of crafts and hobbies do you have?
Oh, not very many of those at, uh,
sometimes I, I play the trumpet,
and sometimes I work on trumpet mouthpieces.
Uh-huh.
And then I have a five year old daughter
and we cut out things, kind of, you know, and color and, uh, and, uh, use markers and things like that.
Uh-huh.
Um, how about you?
In,
well I used to be more into crafts, when I was younger, like high school stuff.
I was in four H
and I did a lot of latch hook made rugs and stuff.
Uh-huh.
Um, and, uh, I've learned how to crochet,
but I don't really know,
I mean, I don't do it that much.
Not really an indoor hobby type person unless the weather's really bad.
Um.
I'd  rather be outside.
Yeah,
exactly.
Um, I used to play trombone
Uh-huh.
I don't know if that was a,
not really,
I don't play it that much any more,
but I, um,
what else do I do.
Mainly do reading.
I don't have a lot of crafty type things I do.
Uh-huh.
But, uh, what are some other things you enjoy?
I don't know.
My, my father is in the, in the antique business.
Uh-huh
And he, uh, he goes around to garage sales
and he buys all kinds of, um, china and figurines and statues and  stuff.
Uh-huh.
And, um, there's some stuff that's really for, uh, auto repair.
It's called J B Weld
Uh-huh.
and I repaired a, a gasoline tank with it once.
But he, mixes colors in it.
It's an epoxy resin that you mix together.
Oh, cool.
And he makes like,
the other day he was working on a hand that was shattered on a, a statue that's real small,
it's like about maybe
the hand's about the size of a cricket. And, uh, has, uh, like the forefinger sticking out and the thumb sticking out,
Oh, wow.
and he was repairing that,
and, uh, it came out pretty good.
It's kind of a, kind of a ivory color all over and  and, uh,  has some age spots in it,
Uh-huh.
and it looked, you know, just like it, it had been there all the time.
Huh
And he fixed some, fixes some bowls that have the cracks or chips in them, and, uh, molds that in.
He had a blue, blue bowl a few weeks ago that he, he fixed that way.
Uh-huh.
It worked out real well, too.
And then,  And and then he, uh, he thatches, uh, you know, those, uh, thatched chairs.
Do you  ever,
Huh?
Yeah.
Course that's like that, that, uh, hooking that you were talking about.
Yeah.
That takes a lot of time.
That's great that he has a lot of hobbies and stuff.
Yeah.
And he used to paint, um, a long time ago,
but I think he's stopped pretty much now.
Oh
But outside of, outside of art class in, in school, I, I stopped doing most of that, unless I, I mean, like he has a computer,
and I use, um, the graphics um, software on that, to, uh, to do figures and to look at things, you know, see how they work.
Yeah.
Right.
That sounds interesting.
Uh-huh.
Um, does, does he ever, uh, refinish furniture or anything like that?
Oh, yeah,
sometimes,
but it's not one of my favorite things, especially from the vapors,
and we had, uh, an entertainment center we did last year.
Uh, we bought it at an, unfinished, uh, furniture place
Uh-huh
Pretty time consuming, isn't it?
Oh, yeah.
But, it's it's nice to have it when you're done,
I mean, looks pretty.
Uh-huh,
sure is.
So, I've done that once
but it didn't come out that well.
Did you use a, did you use a Zar stain?
Uh, I don't remember.
It was,
I had my parents buy everything,
and I ended up,
it was their table, their kitchen table.
It came out really dark.
Um, they had a, um,
well I saw the commercial on T V,
and they,
and, uh, and the people at the unfinished store recommended it,
that's called,
it's Z, A R
Uh-huh.
And, uh, it spreads real evenly
and it doesn't dry too fast,
so it's,
if you get too much in one spot you can smooth it out.
Yeah.
And uh, we, put, we put tung oil on it.
Kind of made it sticky for a while.
But after it dried out, it was, you know, it was real hard,
and it was all right.
I remember it took me a long time,
it took me like several months, or several weeks to do it during the summer,
and then after I got it done it was pretty dark, and ended up not being real smooth looking.
Since I've moved away they've had it redone.
So, I kind of, kind of gave that hobby up real quick.
Yeah.
But, I don't know.
Like I said, I like doing a lot of outdoor stuff,
so but during Four H, I mean they really encouraged to do all kinds of crafty stuff, which is interesting,
I like that
Uh-huh
Were you in a, were you the Girl Scouts, too
or,
No,
well, yeah
when I was real young I was for a couple, of years
Excuse me.
So, uh, anyway, it was nice talking to you Dudley.
Well, it was nice talking to you.
Have a good day now.
Okay,
you too.
Bye or
Bye-bye.

I pushed it.
Okay.
So what do you you in your lawn?
Do you do it yourself
or do you hire someone to do it?
Uh, no
we've been doing it ourselves for most of the time, uh, find that it's really a little more economical,
and we have, oh, I find that I have the time,
and I kind of enjoyed it over here in Texas.
I used to live in Arizona,
and it was very very frustrating, because I didn't have the watering system
and it was, it was just too much work and not enough enjoyment.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
But over here we get enough water you know, naturally as well have the automatic sprinklers,
and so it's a lot more rewarding
Yeah,
right.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
so.
Well, we do our own out here, uh, you know, mow it ourselves and everything,
but, uh, our water supply right now is bad.
We need rain badly
Oh, that's right.
Uh, we can water, here in Patterson, I can water on Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturday and Sunday, four days a week.
Uh-huh.
So.
Is that enough during the hotter times of the year?
It was this last summer,
yeah.
Uh-huh.
Uh, now if it, we don't get some rain, they might limit it to not even four times, you know
Yeah,
yeah.
but, uh, yeah,
we do our our, you know, mowing ourselves and everything,
and I do our planting of bulbs and things where I can have some spring flowers
Uh-huh.
and, uh,
Yeah,
I find that I've been doing a lot of perennial planting, which I never did before
Uh-huh.
and it's been real enjoyable, although I didn't do any this last fall, because our past winters have been so cold,  um  they'd freeze down,
Uh-huh.
and by the time they, the flowers would come back to life it was supposedly the time to pull things out for the spring and summer planting
Oh.
So I was getting kind of disillusioned and tired and, and spending too much money on something that was kind of more of a problem than it was rewarding,
so um, I'm going to try to wait now and just do the spring and summer type plantings and see how that, you know,  feels.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We have quite a few roses.
I just, uh, we, in fact we just pruned them way down,
and I just had to replace one of them,
so I just bought that yesterday,
and I'll probably go outside today and plant that.
Uh-huh.
But, um, I like to have the roses where I can have cut flowers all year long.
Yeah,
those are enjoyable.
I even had, uh, roses on my table for Christmas dinner which was really pretty, you know
Oh, did you?
Uh-huh
But, um, other than the roses I don't have too many flowers.
I plant gladiolas
Um, those are nice.
and those are always pretty,
but they get so tall,
and they, they bend over so fast you know.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
yeah.
I haven't done much in, in bulbs.
In fact I received as a Christmas present a, a planter that had bulbs in it, that we were supposed to go ahead and water it any time and after it started to sprout put in a sunny window,
and it it just grew like crazy,
Uh-huh.
but I don't have any flowers on it.
I don't know how long that takes, or if there's anything I need to do differently.
Um.
It's just nice and green right now
Uh-huh,
well, is it that, one of those Amaryllis?
Uh, no
No,
huh.
I'm thinking White Narcissus or something like a like a white paper flower or so.
Oh, okay.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh,
uh-huh.
And, uh.
Do you have a big yard?
No,
not really,
and in Plano and most of the newer areas of Texas, uh, they have just the, the minimum square footage for lots, to where you get a little bit of a backyard,
we have a pool in our backyard,
and we did plan it to where we have some, some play yard left over,
Uh-huh.
but it's, it's, um, you know, very small.
Uh-huh.
But most of the houses here, if you have a pool, you don't have anything else in the backyard
Yeah,
right,
right.
that's about the size  of most of them.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
So, uh I guess we're kind of fortunate.
Um.
Everyone looks at that, with our at our yard with kind of sense of awe, like wow, you really got, you know, some grass back there.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh,
uh-huh.
Well.
Well, that makes it nice.
Yeah.
Well, it's hot enough here in the summer time that we could have a pool,
but we don't have one you know,
Uh-huh.
but they are a lot of people that do have pools around here you know
Yeah.
Yeah.
but we just, we just have dogs and, um, and grass you know, the cement work and a little play set we made for a garden.
Uh-huh.
Uh, yeah.
Yeah.
So we do have a garden, you know.
It's just a small one, you know,
but we, had lots of tomatoes, and, uh, zucchini
Oh.
it's amazing what you can get out of a little
Uh-huh.
you know, it's probably about twenty by, I don't know, twenty by six, something like that,
and it's amazing what you can, you know, how many plants you can plant in there
Yeah,
yeah.
but it was nice.
Few cucumbers.
That's one part of gardening I haven't tried yet,
and I don't think this yard is a very,
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.

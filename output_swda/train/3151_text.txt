Well, how do you feel about spot spot testing for drugs?
Well, basically I think it would be a good idea myself.
I, uh, I think if somebody's not on drugs, they have no reason, you know, to be afraid of it.
Uh-huh.
Uh, I do think that there has to be some controls, uh,
like, I don't think one test positive should, uh, be, uh, the end of it, you know.
Right.
I,  I think they should test more than once.
Yeah,
it's, it's  it's refreshing to hear somebody, that has a similar opinion as mine.
It,
I mean, all these people that are against it that may, you know, they may not even be on drugs.
They, they call it an invasion of privacy.
Uh-huh
And I don't see that.
To me that just doesn't sound like a valid argument because this company is paying you good money that you're working for
That's right.
and they, I believe that, they have the right to know if you're using a, a dangerous substance
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
But,
There's  so many jobs that, uh, really have other people's lives in their hands or even their own life
and, you know, and it's, uh
Uh-huh.
uh, how can you do anything about a problem besides if you don't know about it?
Right.
You know, and I just, um, I,  I think  there definitely needs to be some control to it.
Right .
I guess it is possible to have a false positive report.
Yes.
No,
I, I, I agree that, you know, you, there needs to be a, a well thought out, sane approach to, how to administer that program.
Uh-huh.
Just because  you, you, something can get mixed in the mail,
or uh, the chemicals could react incorrectly than, than what you would expect them to.
Uh-huh.
And, yeah,
you, you know
Or somebody's  test gets mixed up with somebody else's.
Right.
I mean,  those things do happen.
Yeah.
Uh, I certainly wouldn't want people's lives ruined  uh, wrongly.
Right,
and, you know, I've
the, the, the company that I work for, uh, has just recently, well, you know, within the last couple of years, instituted for all new hired employees,
they submit to a urine test.
Uh-huh
And, they, they say that there's been, you know, they, they, they've also implemented random testing.
Uh-huh.
And , it hasn't happened to me in the couple of years that, you know, it's been in progress
Uh-huh.
but, uh,  I, I fully agree with it
and there's, you know, there's all these memos going around about folks that are disgruntled and feel it's an invasion of privacy,
and I, I agree with you.
Uh-huh.
If, if, if you feel it's an invasion of privacy, you've, you've probably got something you're trying to hide
Yeah
and you maybe need to look for some other type of job to do  that,  uh, doesn't require the testing.
Yeah.
Right.
Uh, to me, it's, to me it's not an invasion or privacy.
I think it's people have a right to know if, if, uh, their, their life maybe's in jeopardy or, uh, Yeah.
Or, the quality of their product.
Their work, the work they're doing for their company.
Uh, those things are all affected.
If not immediately, it certainly does eventually.
Yeah.
I think that's where a lot of the problem is at first.
It doesn't seem to, uh, bother the quality of work
Uh-huh.
but eventually it does.
Right,
because it usually requires more and more of that substance that you're misusing to get the same effect.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Um.
Course, I feel the same way on the AIDS problem.
I, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy,
that's the only communicable disease that they're not allowed to test for you know,
and it's destroying a  lot of   people's lives
and then   and one of the  few that they don't have a cure for
Yeah,
and it's, you know, it's, it's destroying people's lives
and I, I think that person, plus anybody in danger should, should know about it and be aware of it.
Yeah.
I don't know.
It's, it's kind of hard to
I guess the gay movement has had a lot to do with considering that, that, uh, an invasion of privacy.
Of course, that's not supposed to be what we're talking about today, I guess.
So, I kind of get off on a tangent here.
Yeah
Uh, do you work for, uh, Texas Instruments?
Yes,
I do.
Uh-huh.
And I'm, I'm down in the, the central,
but I don't know how familiar you are with Texas,
but I'm in a, we live in a town, uh, near a town called Temple. Which is right in between Waco and Austin on the freeway.
Um.
Oh, that's probably why,
my brother did live in Grapevine, Texas.
That's near Dallas.
Right.
Uh-huh.
We're probably about two, two and a half hours south of him.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
So.
It's pretty hot down there probably.
Oh my!
Yeah
It's, actually, we got about two inches of rain in about three hours, yesterday.
Oh, did you  really?
And it's   cooled things  down somewhat.
Oh, that's great.
It's getting more humid  now,
but,
Uh-huh.
We, we need rain real bad up here.
Uh-huh
It's, uh, everything's really getting dry.
It's, uh,
Yeah
It's been about three weeks since we've had any.
Yeah.
It's kind of at a dangerous level here.
People hauling water,
and, uh it's getting real bad.
Um.
Wow.
So.
How about that?
So.
Well, I hope you do get some rain up there.
Um So do I
I
Uh, I can't think of anything else, uh.
Yeah,
I, I guess being in  agreement  kind of tends to limit the conversation  you know
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh, I can understand
I know if somebody is using drugs and doesn't think there's anything wrong with them, I can see them objecting. You know?
there's a lot of people that think that there's nothing wrong with .
One of the things I found interesting,
it, it's funny that you mentioned that,
T I is pretty much a worldwide company
Uh-huh.
and we have manufacturing plants all around the world including some places where the use of certain drugs that are illegal here are not illegal.
Uh-huh.
Um. Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
Yeah,
they don't have to submit to drug testing like, like they do here in the States and some places abroad.
Oh, I'll be darn.
Yeah,
I thought that was kind of interesting  too.
Yeah,
yeah,
the different cultures and that  too, uh
Yeah.
I mean, uh, uh,  from a quality standpoint, that's not, I mean, just because it's not illegal doesn't mean it doesn't affect you the same way.
No,
no.
I'm sure it would have to affect you the same way.
I, I can't think that would make any difference  whether  it was legal or not,
Yeah.
Right.
it,  it would still have to affect you the same way.
Yeah,
but, like if you're going to do business in another country, you've got to respect their rules.
Uh-huh.
I mean if, if, you know, that, that's the trade off.
Oh yeah.
You can't you go by their laws.
Yeah.
The same way our people have to go by their laws when they're over there.
That's why a lot get in trouble because they have to follow their rules
Huh
and, uh some of the countries are very much against drugs
Right.
and you use them, you pay for it
Usually with you life in some  places.
Yeah,
a lot of them.
Yeah.
Where, where  is it they lose the, if they steal they lose a  thumb or a finger?
That's right.
Yeah,
from the Middle East.
Is that where it is?
Yeah.
Iraq, Iran, in that area.
I thought, wow
Yeah
You know, that's quite a deterrent
Well, in Saudi Arabia, you know, using, uh, alcohol and drugs and something like that, you get the death penalty.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So, it's pretty strict over there
Yeah.
So I guess, you know, we, we have so many freedoms over here we sometimes forget about  how   great out country  really is.
Well,   people tend to  take the first amendment out of context. Which, which means you know, I could do anything I want to
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
and you can't stop me,
and you know
They, they abuse it is what they do.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So, that's,
So,
I don't know.
I'm, I'm glad to see more and more companies implementing the policy,

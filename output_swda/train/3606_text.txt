What are your favorite shows?
Well, I, it's doesn't seem like I get enough time to watch much T V,
but the ones that are out now.
Uh-huh.
I, I've watched that SISTERS a couple of times.
I think that's kind of a good show.
I've never seen that.
Haven't you?
Huh-uh.
Oh. I like that one,
and, um, I'm trying to think.
I, I don't even know if I have any other real regular ones that I watch.
How about you?
Um, I like L A LAW not because it's realistic, but it's entertaining.
Oh, uh-huh,
uh-huh.
I do like that.
Um.
Yeah,
occasionally I'll see that one.
Let's see.
I watch CHEERS sometimes. And, mostly just movies, when there's a good movie on.
Do you?
Uh-huh.
Actually when there isn't a good movie on, too.
Oh.
I just like to have the T V on if, you know, if I'm home alone or something
Oh, uh-huh.
have,
either the radio or the T V got to be on the whole time.
Yeah,
uh, oh, I do,
I kind of have gotten into a couple of soaps lately.
Oh, really.
I've, well, I've been home with a, um,
I have a baby,
and and so I've haven't seemed to have gotten out as much,
Uh-huh.
and so I'll, I'll watch a soap occasionally.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Do you watch any of those?
I, well, I don't, because I work all day.
Uh-huh.
But, um, I
I usually do if I'm home for a couple of days, like, you know, around Christmas or whatever,
after a while I'll start watching it
Uh-huh.
and then on,
for a while I'll ask people if they know what happened
Oh
and then I'll just forget it.
what, what ones do you get into?
Uh, I don't even remember
the last time I watched was back in college.
It was like GENERAL HOSPITAL or something
Oh, uh-huh.
and I maybe watched it for a week
Oh.
but, um, I know that people used to arrange their whole schedules around the, you know,
they wouldn't take a class that was in the middle of their soap opera.
How funny,
oh, yeah.
It was a,
Oh, I don't get into them that much.
When I'm home, sometimes in the day I'll I'll watch them
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
but, yeah, oh, I was really trying to think.
I don't even know if there's any other shows that I watch or else.
Well, you said you have kids.
How old?
Oh, I have a six year old,
and I have a, um,
he'll be a year old in January.
So, you're, you aren't a SESAME STREET fan?
Well, they do, they watch it.
My six year old's kind of,
he's outgrown that one a little bit,
but but, I've started to turn it on a little bit for the baby,
Uh-huh.
and he's kind of, he's entertained by it.
Uh-huh.
So, yes,
I, I do watch that one.
Supposed to be a great babysitter
Yeah,
well, they're not entertained for too long with it.
He's, he's still too little,
but yeah,
Yeah.
I do turn that on.
Um.
And I, I do like, um, DONAHUE.
Uh-huh.
Sometimes I watch that.
I think he has some interesting things on it.
I know,
what time is that on, *listen; strange ? placement
I never see it?
Um, that's on at, let's see, it's on at four.
Oh, okay.
I'm not home then,
that's why I don't see it.
Yeah,
I'll watch that occasionally.
He's got some real,
I don't know,
there's some real weird people that, he seems to come up with.
Isn't it strange how people are fascinated by other people that they think are strange
Yes.
Yeah,
oh, yeah.
. He does have some real bizarre things, I think.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
So, other than that, I don't know.
What's that?
Guess I'm not much of a T V person really.
Yeah,
well, I guess it wasn't a real good topic for us,
but Well, tell me,
is it snowing up there?
Um, no.
No.
It snowed a little bit, um, probably about four days ago
Uh-huh.
and they said we weren't going to get any more for Christmas.
Yeah
Oh.
there is snow on the ground.
Well, that's nice.
I, I wish it would snow a little bit more.
I've heard it's raining there.
Oh, gosh,
we've broken all sorts of records.
Oh really.
They've got,
I mean, we still have some highways closed,
and it stopped raining almost twenty-four hours ago.
Oh, my goodness.
But, um, oh, just phenomenal,
I mean, I, you know,
you see it on the news all the time,
but until you've really seen it, it it doesn't really hit you.
Yeah.
But I was driving home from work Friday,
and I saw, there were some stop signs, I mean, submerged up to the writing on the stop sign,
and that was just
Oh, goodness.
it was amazing to me.
Oh, gee
so.
So.
So there has been some flooding
and,
Oh, there's been a lot,
yeah.
It's, it's too bad
but you know, the thing is that this happens,
in the last three years it's happened at least once a year, if not twice. But the people continue to move back in the flood zones.
Uh-huh.
Oh, gee.
So, I don't know.
I mean, you got to wonder how long they're going to keep doing that for.
Yeah.
I don't think I would.
Oh, boy.
Because they just finished cleaning up from the last flood.
Yeah,
oh, what a mess.
Yeah.
Well, now, do you work for T I?
Yeah,
I do,
yeah.
oh, uh-huh.
Huh. Well, this has been an interesting thing to do.
Have you made a lot of calls
or,
Um, I've, I've probably talked maybe to five people.
Uh-huh.
My husband is doing it too,
and he's talked to a few more than me,
Oh.
and, but it's been real interesting and kind of fun.
Do you get paid for these?
Um, five dollars.
Five dollars a call?
Uh-huh.
Gosh,
I wish I could do that
Uh, don't you have to do it as part of its,
We can't get paid for it.
Don't you have to do it,

All rightie.
Okay.
Do you have a budget that you go on?
Yeah.
I sure do.
Uh, I have, it's pretty much a ledger sheet
and I just write down all my bills, how much I'm going to have to pay
and I do it per paycheck for me which is every other week.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh, I mean I include everything from groceries to insurance to car payments to credit card payments, you know, everything.
Uh-huh.
And it tends to work out pretty well that way.
I can anticipate, you know, a little better.
I usually try to guesstimate
and then when the bill actually comes in, I go ahead and fill in the actual amount.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
That way I know how much pocket change I'm going to have left  at the end of the month  or at the end of the paycheck anyway.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
Uh-huh
So that works okay for me.
Uh-huh.
Well, my bills I usually know approximately how much they're going to be.
Right.
Each month they are more or less just about the same, you know.
Uh-huh,
same here.
Uh, very  seldom are they any different.
And then, uh, like for groceries and everything, we try to put, like, two hundred and fifty dollars in a little can in the kitchen
Uh-huh.
and then that's what we use to buy the groceries with.
Oh, okay.
And then we put our receipts in there, you know,
and usually that's enough.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, but I don't have any, you know, small children to have anything extra come up, you know, like, uh, running to the doctor or something like that with them.
Right.
Luckily I don't either.
I mean, you know, maybe my cat would get sick
but, I mean, usually that's not so much that it would throw me off
Yeah,
yeah,
right.
In fact, I did have to take my dog to the vet the other day
But you so you know what  I'm saying,
yeah.
Yeah.
that, it's worse than having a kid, huh?
I,
sometimes it can be.
Yeah.
Sometimes  it can be.
I guess the worst thing I've ever had come out is like car maintenance kinds of things.
Uh-huh.
But I do try to build in a little extra money each month to, to be able to do that type of thing
so.
Yeah,
uh, I'm not working right now.
I worked for P I E
and then, uh, they went bankrupt
so I just went ahead and took my early pension.
Uh-huh.
Oh, uh-huh.
But I only get that once a month.
Oh, that's tough.
Yeah
My roommate only gets paid once a month
and that last week's pretty lean generally speaking
Yeah.
So,
so.
Yeah.
So, you know, I really have to try to budget, that I don't go over that amount, you know, each month.
Right.
I, for, for years got paid once a month
and, and in ways I liked it because I could go ahead and pay all my bills at once.
Uh-huh.
There's always one or two stragglers that usually they were,
for me it worked out that they were the smaller ones
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
but I would pay all of them at one sitting
and I would know okay, you can go spend this much on groceries now and you get this much a week and that is it.
Yeah,
right.
And, and it worked okay for me.
Uh-huh.
I don't know.
And,
Right  now I, I'm in the mode of trying to dig out of debt, I think as everybody is
and so,
Oh, yeah.
Right now it's terrible isn't it?
It's, yeah, it's really bad.
Yeah.
But, uh, it's going pretty well
and I've got a real good plan mapped out here,
so.
Uh-huh.
I also like long-term Christmas club you know.
I used to belong to a Christmas club,
last year I didn't.
Uh-huh.
Then, so then, naturally, Christmas comes along
and that puts you behind too, you know.
So this year, now I have them taking out fifty dollars a month  out of my  checking account for my Christmas club.
Oh that's,
Yeah.
So I figure, you know, that's going to help some.
That'll cover your gifts come Christmas time.
That'll,
yeah,
Yeah,
right,  you know.
That'll be good,
yeah
most people are spending three or four months you know, at least,  digging out after Christmas
so.
Right,
right.
And I'm
Yeah,
I, I was  pretty fortunate this Christmas
I didn't get in debt,
so.
Oh, that's good.
I'm taking like, uh, sewing lessons to try to learn how to sew better than what I can
Uh-huh.
so I won't have to go out and buy the ready-made clothes anymore.
Oh, uh-huh.
It's so rare
you hear anybody doing that  any longer
I know.
I even bought myself a Surgery , you know,
and I just love it.
I haven't learned everything to do on it yet
but I figure that will help me save you know.
Yeah.
My, uh, roommate does sew some
and, and, uh, she hasn't sewed anything in a long time
but I, I'm sure that she could pick it up again.
My mother always sewed.
She tried to teach me when I was young but not interested
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Well,  see, some people are, some aren't
because  I have some sisters, I have three sisters
Yeah.
and none of those are really interested in sewing.
Yeah.
But that's a real good way to save money, though by doing that.
Yeah,
and then I can also, you know, do some crafts and sell those at garage sales.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
So, which I've been doing.
Well, that's a good way to, to make a little extra money.
Uh-huh.
Well, this is another way that I'm making a little extra money
so that was, you know, nice that I tripped over this opportunity
and you're actually my first call.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
Oh.
I had not, uh, done
I, I guess today  today's my first day that I  could  even do it.
Well, have you called?
Oh.
Oh, it is?
Yeah,
you beat me to the punch,  here
Oh, well, that, that's nice  you know.
I, I was about to call to get, to see if I could get on with somebody,
so
Uh-huh.
so that was great.
Yeah.
Well I guess that's about all I can talk to about budgets.
When I was working, I, uh, bought a bond a month out of my, you know,
they automatically took it out of  my  out of my payroll.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I take, have some money taken it and put in a Four Oh One K,

So, what sort of car are you interested in getting next?
Well, actually, I love the car I have.
I have a Chrysler LeBaron convertible.
And  I love it.
Ah.
And I would get another one in a minute.
Unless I could afford what I really like which would be a red Ferrari or, you know, a little Corvette or something like that.
And that's what would influence my decision to change because I like a really sporty car.
And I'd love an expensive one
but I probably,  can never afford it
so
Uh, well I understand and can sympathize with that because I also enjoy driving performance automobiles.
Uh, I currently have an eighty-seven, five liter Mustang G T that I've done a bunch of modifications to, to make it, uh, handle and perform better,
Uh-huh.
and I suspect if I were to be able to get another car where object was, uh,
the best car I could get regardless of money, uh, I probably would be tempted by something along the lines of a Lotus or possibly a Ferrari.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Well, I'm a nurse here
and we have a doctor at this hospital that has a beautiful new red Ferrari.
A, a three twenty-eight G T S?
And I couldn't tell you
but it's just beautiful.
And I go out and I love to  touch it
but I can't even do that because of the alarm.
You just go hunting?
So, I just look  at it a lot
Go out and  lust after it.
Really
Exactly.
But it sure is a pretty thing
So have you had the opportunity to drive a Ferrari?
No.
I'm working on it
No,
I really haven't,
no,
huh-uh
I did  test drive a Corvette last year. Maybe the year before.
It was brand new, white,
it was like a big marshmallow.
When you sat in the seats, they adjusted to fit around you.
uh.
I mean they came in and up and out
and I mean, they did whatever
and, and we went for a test drive in that
and I was able to open that up pretty good
and that was really fun.
And I wanted it,
but I had a choice of that or my house
and  I thought that I'd continue,  to live in my house
so.
Yeah,
there, there's something about having a place to live,
I don't know.
Yeah,
you know, it's just necessary.
And I did, I thought well a tent wouldn't be bad but probably not practical.
Could sleep in the back of the 'vette.
Yeah,
right
So,
I find that, uh, that the Corvettes are, are becoming really, really nice cars.
They are, they're pretty aren't they lately
Yeah.
And  they, they've improved, the performance and the suspension such that they're actually a lot of fun to drive.
They really  are.
Really.
It's not like driving a, a Winnebago or something.
Oh, no
No,
no.
See, I'm not into station wagons and vans and things that people are really buying now
and they go isn't that a nice van
and I go, um.
Not really, you know.
How about  a Greyhound bus
Nice.
Yeah.
Nice isn't the word I'd choose.
Maybe practical.
Yeah.
I mean that, you know.
Isn't that a practical van.
There's some that are prettier than others
and
yeah,
the new type is prettier than what their, they used to look like
but I sure don't think it's attractive, you know.
It's not like, like driving a little sports car.
Yeah.
It, it's very hard to find something practical that's also attractive.
Yeah.
I don't think that happens
so, but I, I love mine,
so, and I, I bought it because I drove a friend's in Hawaii
and I just went home
and I walked in
and I picked it out
and he said take it home and bring it back if you want to,
and I never did.
I just went back and signed the papers
and I knew nothing about my car when I got it.
Nothing.
I didn't know how anything worked.
Well, so it was a completely new experience for you.
And I'm sure you enjoyed every minute of it.
Yeah.
And I've had it,
it's almost three years actually.
And I've, I still love it.
I put the top down everywhere I go.
I timed it when I first got it
and it took twenty I mean twenty seconds
and so, I figured there was nowhere I was to late to go that I didn't have twenty more seconds.
Right.
So.
And, and you couldn't get,
how long does it take to go back up? About the  same time.
Twenty seconds,
yeah.
That's all it takes.
I mean, it's just a button, that's  it.
You  release it right at the top,
Yeah,
so
so  you don't have to  get out or anything.
So you won't get,
Yeah
and twenty seconds you probably won't get caught in anything too substantial.
Well I did, actually.
Last week going to the airport,
I just hit a downpour
and I was on a highway going like eighty.
So I really did.
I mean I was soaking wet.
I thought I would drown in the seconds that it took me to pull over
Whoops.
But it all dried out, you know.  Didn't  take long when the sun came out
Yeah.
but it was kind of funny.
I'm sure people around me really enjoyed it
but,
Oh. No I was just down in Austin last week
and the weather was pretty nice too.
So,
Oh
and wasn't it pretty last week with the  Bluebonnets and everything,
yeah,
yeah.
With the Bluebonnets out,
yeah.
It  really was.
Yeah
I decided that Austin is certainly someplace that I could handle living.
is Yeah.
A lot of people say that
and it's pretty far from where I live

Uh, Kate, what kind of, uh, where do you like to eat out?
Well, we, uh, we really like the Mexican food, you know, here in Texas
Yes.
and, uh, so we try and go around to different Mexican restaurants trying them out,
and so, uh, Tia's is probably our favorite, uh, restaurant there,
and I think they have one of the best services that, uh, that we really like it.
Do you?
Have you tried Mother Mesquites?
No.
Where's that at?
That's at Skillman and L B J
Uh-huh.
there is,
it's where Skillman, uh, curves into Forest Lane
Uh-huh.
and it's real good Mexican food.
Another real good one is, uh, Rafael's down on McKinney Avenue.
Oh.
They're both very good.
Really?
Uh-huh.
Oh, that, uh,
no,
we haven't explored, uh, you know, too many places.
Um, you know, lot of the big name brand, I guess, uh, chains
Chains,
uh-huh.
yeah,
but, um, oh, we've tried places, you know, down, uh, by the Collin Creek Mall,
the, uh, you know, Alvarez,
and, um, gosh we tried, what was across the street, El Paso's El Chico's or something,
Oh, El Chico's or El Fenix one,
yeah,
something something like that,
uh-huh
uh-huh,
uh-huh.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
Well, I like Tia's better than I do El Chico's or El Fenix.
Yeah,
yeah.
Uh, much better.
Uh, Mother Mesquite's is one of our favorites
but then fajitas are one of my, uh,
I like it better than just about anything
Oh, yes.
and they make very good fajitas there in their own, uh, homemade flour tortillas that are just absolutely wonderful.
Yes.
Oh.
Especially with butter and honey on them
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
Oh, I know,
I tell, I tell you what.
They are, they just, um, they're excellent, uh, excellent food.
I wish I could make them here at home.
Yes,
yes,
so do I.
Just can't make those flour tortillas.
But,
Well, what else do you like?
Well, I love, uh, I love seafood
Uh-huh.
and I notice they have like the, you know, The Louisiana Purchase, um,
Razzoo's has opened up down, you know, off of, um, um, oh, close to six thirty-five.
Yes,
now I haven't eaten there.
Have you eaten there?
Yes.
I have eaten there.
Now the only problem, *note the setup for a negative comment
I love the food.
It's a lot of cajun food and good seafood,
Uh-huh.
but, uh, the service has always been so strange, every time I've been in there.
Mostly it's been at lunch time
Uh-huh.
and, uh, but I hear at night though they have, uh, you know, the outdoor, um, bar,
and, um, uh, that's it's really, uh, you know, kind of lively.
Uh-huh.
So, it's, it's really good. All their blackened grill stuff.
Oh, I, we like, uh, uh, for the cajun, the spicy, we like Atchafalaya's out on Belt Line, in Addison
Uh-huh.
and it's a good restaurant.
Oh, well that sounds great.
And fish, for one of the best fish restaurants in town is either Vincent's there in Plano or, uh, I believe it's a Rusty Scupper over on, uh, uh, Dallas Parkway in Addison, which is absolutely wonderful.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
The service is great.
They have every kind of fish that you could imagine you'd want
Uh-huh.
and the, the atmosphere is wonderful too.
If you want a really special night out and fish food that's a good place to go.
Uh-huh.
Oh well, I, uh, I have children and, and work,
and so we, uh, we can eat a lot of fast food
I can remember when our children were small.
Uh-huh.
We lived in the Chicago area at the time,
and we had a lot of McDonalds when they were first coming out.
Yeah
I know.
I can't look a McDonalds in the face now.
I, I know,
I, I'm so sick of McDonalds,
and we used to eat there, we used to eat there all the time.
And, so now we, we, we branch out at this Wendy's or some other fast food joint.
Well, Taco Bueno's good
Oh and, and cheap too.
And cheap,
and cheap.
Yeah,
but, but the kids, they've got those expensive tastes
so, uh, they like Tia's
so they can sit down and all that good kind of stuff.
Yes,
yes
yes.
Sounds like my grandchildren.
Yeah,
I know.
They, they, they're just spoiled rotten,
but, uh, but, no,
I, uh, uh, we love to eat out,
of course, it's just so much easier and simpler
Oh, yes.
yeah.
So we, uh, we usually eat out generally two or three times a week.
Well, it's just my husband and I,
and it's either T V dinners at home or we go out to eat.
Yeah,
yeah.
And I would much rather go out to eat than T V dinners
Oh, me too,
me too.
So, I know, uh, I, I know that I, uh, you know, I just work
and I'm just tired when I get home
and I, I just don't feel like cooking.
Oh, no,
no.
And, uh, you know, on the weekends there's always things to do,
and, uh, so we like to go out to lunch on Saturdays especially.
I like breakfast out.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
I like the IHOP there in Plano.
Yeah,
now I, we've been there twice and, and both times I, just, oh, the food just didn't quite settle with me
Oh.
and I don't know what it was.
Oh, now that's surprising because normally they're just, they're real good.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
Yes,
and I love.
I like because they, they're, even if they're crowded, they're fast service, you know
Uh-huh.
um, don't have to wait forever for a table.
Uh-huh,
yeah.
And we also like Owens, uh country
Oh, family restaurant.
yeah
Uh-huh.
yeah.
We think it's good.
Now I haven't been there
I went to one I think in Ohio or, or, or somewhere up there,
but I've never been to that one here.
I know it's just down the street.
Uh-huh.
It's good.
So. Now have you been to Applebee's.
Yes,
yes.
Yes.
And we like Applebee's.
Yes,
I, I really like that too,
so that was, uh.
Yeah,
it, it's fun.
I like your, up there in Plano, that, uh, Country Steak House.
Oh.
Have you tried it?
I've been, I've been there twice,
uh-huh,
yeah,
so.
We like it because it's fairly reasonable
and they have, we go for the salad bar.
Salad bar,
yes.

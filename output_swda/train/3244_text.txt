My name's Mary Dell,
and I live in the Dallas, Texas area where there's a lot of pollution
Okay,
and I'm up in Wisconsin
Oh.
uh, my name is Terry
Uh-huh.
and, uh, in the small town we don't,
but, uh, we're not that far from the city where there's tons of pollution.
Yes.
Okay,
I'll go ahead and start recording that,
Okay.
Okay, um,
just in particular here in the Twin Cities we have a lot of big corporations
and, um I'm sure there's a lot of pollution.
Oh.
We, uh,
before moving to Wisconsin lived across from where they were, um, gravel pits and also where they were making tar,
Uh-huh.
and so we would occasionally if the wind was blowing the right direction would get the smell of tar
and it would, uh,
Ooh.
smell the continuous,
you knew that you were also breathing that into your lungs,
so and it was like miles away,
Right.
but just the idea of having that come across the way it did in the wind kind of made you know that there was a lot of pollution,
Uh-huh.
and that was just one small corporation that was doing the pollution of that,
but also, um, where we also lived, too, it was very close to a highway,
Uh-huh.
so got a lot of fumes from, uh, trucks and cars
Uh-huh.
and you would literally see the pollution on your furniture,
I mean, it was on your tables,
Oh, gosh,
you would dust every day,
and it was dirty, um, type of dust,
I mean, it wasn't the typical dust that you get way out in the country um
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
for,
I live in a small, um, town now quite a ways from the Twin Cities, about an hour away,
and I may dust once a week,
and that's all it needs versus every day when I lived in the city
Huh I'd never thought about that being a cause,
so.
I have to dust a lot as well.
Oh, yeah,
it, it comes right on through through the screens,
Yeah.
the only way that you could actually live in the, in the city is to close your windows and have an air cleaner system right in your home that would take the air from the outside and clean the air before it would get into the house
Uh-huh.
My goodness.
and so it was quite a dirty city.
Um, if you were well protected by trees, which catch a lot of the pollution then you're fine,
Uh-huh.
but most of the time in the city you have lots of high rises, you have lots of other things that are not catching the pollution
and it's just going for miles and miles and miles,
Uh-huh.
and it's landing somewhere with the wind,
but,
That's kind of the way Dallas is.
We're so flat and open,
and I live in a suburb that doesn't have much vegetation, trees
Sure.
it was all cotton fields,
so we don't have that advantage,
Sure.
and ours I think is primarily cars, where we don't carpool like we should an airport.
Yeah,
yeah.
I work in a building,
I'm nineteen floors up
Uh-huh.
and I look out toward D F W International,
and there's just an awful brown haze all the time
Uh-huh.
and I can imagine it's even worse for people living over near the airport.
Oh, sure,
sure,
yeah.
It's,
I mean, our air quality, um, in the Twin Cities is a lot better than what we've heard about California and maybe in the other areas,
Uh-huh.
but, um, they were always talking about the air quality of today is this, you know, the ozone or whatever,
and it's kind of scary because the air is something we take for granted
Yes.
and many people are too busy getting to work, not thinking about, Okay, I could have carpooled with a friend,
even my husband was, uh, talking to some of the guys at work,
Uh-huh.
now he's, uh, fifteen miles away from work,
but he was talking, wouldn't it be nice to carpool,
and the guy says, Well, it's too close,
it wouldn't pay
Uh-huh.
and, so.
Want to meet my own schedule those are the arguments we hear,
Yeah,
and,
exactly, and so, my husband says, Well, that's fine, you know,
it would save quite a bit on the wear and tear on cars and, you know, the gas,
Uh-huh.
and, no,
everybody has their preference to drive by themselves
or, if they do, they, they drive with one little buddy, uh,
at least it's with one person
Uh-huh.
but most of the time people are saying forget it.
I don't want to carpool,
it's too much of a hassle,
it's too much involvement
But we're paying for it.
but yet,
Yes,
we are,
and I think of my daughter
and I'm sure you think of your children,
and you kind of say to yourself, what kind of future will they have when they think back and say, well, my parents did have the choice to kind of make a difference
Uh-huh.
and maybe people are trying,
but they have to change attitudes,
And it seems to me that it's already so evident with our children having a lot more respiratory infections than we had growing up you can really see it.
Uh-huh.
Sure.
I, I had a chance to go to Bolivia a couple years ago,
and of course there's no industry, very little trash,
they they don't even have that much that they burn, because they consume everything down to the thread,
Sure.
Sure.
Well, they,
and it amazed me,
I, I just had totally forgotten how ...

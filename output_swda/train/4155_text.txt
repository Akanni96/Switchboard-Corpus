Um, what's our topic?
Taxes.
Taxes.
Do we pay too much?
Right.
Right.
Um
Well, do we?
What do you do?
Um,
I guess that,
I mean it all depends really on what kind of bracket you're in.
My tax bracket is, is pretty high up there.
I pay the, I generally pay the maximum tax bracket.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, I think that we're paying too much
because I don't have any children.
Right.
And I pay a lot of property taxes.
Oh, sure.
I don't have any, um, I don't, you know, I don't use an awful lot of city services.
It, it, you know it's like I have to work I have to work all the time just to make enough money to pay the taxes.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Right.
And, um, there's so many people who want a, a of the federal money or the state money or whatever it is
Uh-huh.
and I just,
sometimes, many times I end up feeling like I'm paying too much in taxes.
Right.
How about you?
Do you pay too much?
Uh, well, no,
I can't really complain.
I'm a student, um,
and I I work as a co-op at, uh, Georgia Tech Research Institute.
And, uh, I'm going to get back most of what I earned, I mean most of what I pay in taxes
and, uh, and, uh,  one of  my parents is still claiming me.
Well, when you  when you go out into the, uh, when you go out into the working world it, it changes quickly.
Huh?
Uh-huh.
I'm sure
Um, you look at your paycheck
and you go, oh, my gosh where did it all go
Um, what kind of, what kind of,
uh, well have you pay a lot of in
have you been out working and then gone back to school
or are you, did you go directly from high school into, into college?
I went,
well I did work, um, just very for some time
but I didn't make enough money to really make,  too much of a  difference.
To worry about it.
Right.
Have you, have you been active in, in politics trying to, concerning this?
Have you like worked on political action committees or something like that?
No,
no,
I haven't.
I, uh, I haven't done any of that type of work myself.
Uh-huh.
Um, but every once in a while when I hear up here at, at, uh, in D C area, um, one of the radio stations has been talking about the, the Congress,
um, Congress has added too towards the Members Bank there, you know,
there's a bank that they all bank with,
and I guess it went defunct recently.
Uh-huh.
And one of the Congressmen has, has written in the last three years about a thousand bad checks.
Huh.
And we, we the taxpayers float him a loan for all all those bad checks,  no  interest, no repayment schedule.
Oh.
Really?
And, um, it's causing quite a stir up here,  because  we're so close to D C anyway.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
It's really kind of curious to watch this thing occur.
Oh, sure.
Um, I, I, I think we pay too much.
And I've, I look at my paycheck
and I make,
well, let's see.
They take out in state and federal taxes
Uh-huh.
I think I pay forty-two percent.
Wow.
Forty-two cents out of every dollar I make goes to the government,
and then they charge me sales tax
and they charge me gasoline taxes,
Uh-huh.
taxes.
and they charge me all these others,
and it's just too expensive.
Uh-huh.
I can't believe that
I, I'm just thankful that I don't get all the government that I pay for.
Huh.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
Do you, have you used, um, student loans and things like that that were guaranteed by the government?
No,
no,
I haven't.
Uh, I, uh, my father pays for my, my schooling, my tuition.
So, uh, I'm, I haven't made use of that.
What are you studying down there?
Physics.
Physics.
Uh-huh.
Oh, that sounds like a fun, fun field.
Everybody says that
Scientific.
Huh.
Heavy science.
Are you like in the particle, particle research or anything like that
or is it more, um, applied physics?
Um, I haven't, I haven't gotten too terribly much into my major yet.
Actually, um, the, the degree I'm getting is physics.
There's a different one for applied physics
so I guess you could call it more straight stuff than applied.
Okay.
Well maybe, maybe you can figure out how we can stop this inertia that's, come rolling towards, whatever it's rolling toward.
I doubt about that.
Are, are, is America, I mean are we pretty, pretty steep compared to most countries?
Actually, I don't think we are.
No,
I don't think so either.
Um, like, like  Europe,  um,  England. I know the taxes are a lot higher.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
But they do have socialized medicine and things like that.
Yeah.
And, um, I know I was reading in the paper I believe yesterday that, um, they're talking,
or maybe it was on the

Hello.
Hi.
Okay,
I pressed one
so I guess we're recording now.
Okay.
Okay,  um.
Um,  as far as spare time, they talked about,
I don't, I think,
who has any spare time
I've got a, a six year old and a, um,
well, my baby's one today.
Um.
Today's his birthday.
Um.
And I'm also, I'm expecting,
and, so, I, I don't know,
I haven't had much spare time lately
but,
Okay,
well, I've, I have had some because I was working for P I E,
and they went bankrupt
so I've got quite a bit of spare time right now.
Oh, uh-huh.
And I've been making dolls, cloth dolls.
Oh, have you?
Uh-huh.
Oh.
And, uh,
You sew the bodies and everything?
Yeah,
it's a, they're all cloth.
It's not, uh, any porcelain at all.
So, so you just sew everything up, huh?
Yeah
Oh.
and I make the clothes for them.
Uh-huh.
What kind
And.
do they have yarn hair
or,
Um, no,
you can get the little curly hair at the craft shop.
Oh, uh-huh.
Oh.
I made some of them with that hair
and then, uh, don't ask me what the other hair I made,
it looked like, um, it looked,
well, I made some of them with regular wigs.
Oh, did you?
I went to the flea markets and bought, you know, like the wigs for a dollar.
Oh, uh-huh.
Then I cut a V shape out of the back of them and then sewed them on.
Oh, my goodness.
It sounds like you're creative.
They looked really cute
Uh, do you sell them?
I have sold five of them, so far.
Oh, have you?
Uh-huh.
I just have to get a place where, you know, I can sell them actually.
Yeah,
I bet.
How long does it take you to make one?
Uh, if I would just work all day long, making the clothes and everything, probably about two and a half days.
Oh, really?
Uh-huh.
Oh.
So.
Do you enjoy it?
Yes
Yeah.
I really do.
Uh-huh.
And, then I also crochet
and,
I, I, I can crochet and knit.
Um, actually, I started an afghan,
but it's been a whole long time ago probably over a year ago
Yeah.
and it's sitting in my closet half done right now,
but, it's a knitting one.
And,
Yeah.
I tried knitting first,
but, I don't know,
I, I didn't like it.
Oh, didn't you.
So then I went to crocheting,
but now I want to learn how to knit again.
Oh.
I
You know.
Yeah,
I enjoy knitting.
I, I kind of like that,
but I just, like I say, haven't done it for a while.
Uh-huh.
And I do like sewing sometimes.
I, I've made a few of the, you know, just the little valence curtains in my house, and things like that.
Uh-huh.
But, it, it's just finding the time for these things that you you enjoy.
Yeah,
yeah.
But,
Yeah,
I, in fact, I just bought a serger in December.
oh, I would love one of these.
Yeah.
Oh, that's neat.
I haven't done everything on it yet, you know,
but just what little bit I have used it for, I really like it.
Oh, those are wonderful aren't they.
You know, especially making the seams and things like that you know, it's, it's got such a professional finish on them.
Oh, yeah,
that, and that's what I hate doing is the finishing stuff.
Yeah.
It'd be nice to have that.
So I like that.
Oh, that's neat.
And.
Well, do you have, um, uh,
I guess you're kind of young,
I was going to say, do you have grand kids or anything to make dolls for.
Well, fifty-seven's not young,
but no,
my son's, has been married for almost ten years,
but they don't have any children.
Oh, uh-huh.
So, I just make clothes for my dolls.
Oh, well.
Well, how did you get involved in that?
Just, you know, just like sewing and stuff and decided to buy a pattern and try to make a doll.
So you did buy a pattern, and then  started from there.
And they, they turned  out really cute.
Yeah,
you got to have a pattern for the body you know.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
And, uh,
have you ever seen those bunnies that they dress?
Yes.
Yes.
Yeah,
I, I did make some clothes for one of those dress one of those.
Aren't they cute?
Yeah,
I have quite a few of them actually in my house,
I, and most of them I have bought, um, already clothed,
but  I did  I did make the dress on one,
Uh-huh.
and I kind of made the pattern up.
It's not, it's probably not the best
but
No,
I, I bought a bunny pattern one time,
but when I sewed it up, the face of it looked like a mouse.
Oh, it did?
Uh-huh.
Oh.
See, it was too pointed.
Oh.
So I tore it back apart again,
and I haven't tried another one.
You haven't sewn it back up, huh?
No,
but I bought a little lamb pattern and the material and everything to make it out of,
but I haven't made it  yet.
Uh-huh.
Uh, do you do any kind of painting or anything?
No,
I don't paint, except I stenciled my wall.
Uh-huh.
Oh, uh-huh.
I I tried that,
I did, I, I ended up just stenciling a, um, a blind, like a, just a roller shade.
Uh-huh.
But, I, I can, I had a hard time stenciling.
For some reason I just couldn't do it.
Oh, really?
And people have told me it's very easy.
Oh, yeah,
I, my neighbor did it first
and I seen her house
and I saw how beautiful it looked,
so then I decided well, I was going to do it,
and  uh, it turned out really, really good.
Well.
What design did you use?
Uh, mostly flowers you know.
Oh, uh-huh.
And, what room?
I've done it in the all, uh, all my rooms.
Have you?
I put it in the bedrooms and the bathroom,

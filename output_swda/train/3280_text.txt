Okay.
Um, I very seldom read a newspaper.
I get most of my news information from T V.
Mainly, um, if I'm really wanting an in-depth thing I'll watch C N N.
Uh-huh.
And I find it one of the best.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, otherwise it's just one of the regular, uh, channels eight or five.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, where do you get yours?
Uh, mostly from T V too.
I usually start watching the news at five and watch it at five thirty and six sometimes and, and then again at ten maybe just the headlines.
Uh-huh.
Um, we do take the DALLAS MORNING NEWS
and, uh, once in a while I'll sit down and read, read it, you know,
but not very often do I read the whole thing.
Quite often just scan through the headlines
and,
Uh-huh.
Well, I take the DALLAS MORNING NEWS
and, and my husband, uh, he reads it cover to cover.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, if he thinks there's something that I need to know about he'll say, you know, here you need to read this
and, uh I don't know
Uh-huh.
it,
I kind of quit reading it, oh, I don't know several years ago when the kids were teenagers.
It just seems like I was so busy all the time,
and if I wanted to read, I wanted to read something light and relaxing and and, uh, things like that
Yeah.
and so I
and it got so depressing
Yeah
Seems like it wasn't anything but bad news
Yeah.
If there's something, you know, that I want to know more about or
might be the Killeen murders.
I've been kind of intrigued.
I guess it's kind of the sadist in everyone
You just,
Yes,
yes.
I, I will pick up if there's something really gruesome in there
I'll go through and read it.
Uh, but I find that I do better with, oh, remembering it and everything if I watch, uh, the T V you know,
Yeah.
and, and they kind of capsize it and everything
Yeah.
and watch,
and I think sometimes it's, you know maybe a little biased, you know
Right.
Oh, yeah.
and sometimes. You don't, you get the sensationalism as opposed to just pure facts.
Yeah.
That's true.
You know.
I wanted a little more detail like, you know,
they would tell more about the people that were killed, where they were from and how old they were.
And I guess you just, you know, you you just want to know
and with interest, you know I found some people that were members of our church which was different.
And that made you even feel a little more kin to, to what was going on.
Well, you know, of the same, same type of church that we belong to.
Oh, the same type of church.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
Yeah,
so that made it a little more and that they were from Utah also
so.
Oh, uh-huh,
uh-huh.
So that was interesting,
but I enjoy the news.
I, I think our seven year old even once in a while will sit down and watch it with us,
Uh-huh.
so.
I used to, uh,
or I didn't used to
but, uh
No.
when my grandchildren had, uh, have stayed over before and even maybe when our kids were younger one of the channels used to give brief inserts of news at a child's level.
Uh-huh.
And I thought that was very interesting,
and I thought that was very important for kids.
Like they brought down something that had happened like if there was something going on, uh, in the war, they would bring it down to a child's level in words you know, that they could understand what was going on.
Huh.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, I noticed that my grandchildren seemed to kind of enjoy that.
The oldest one he's nine
Right.
and, uh, he would particularly enjoy this
been a couple of years ago.
Yeah.
And, uh, I thought, I think that's really interesting.
Actually I even understood it better
Yeah,
that's nice sometimes when they they pull it down a little bit like that.
Yeah
Yeah,
you know. And, uh, but as I said, uh, I you know,
Right.
Nobody should get that way about the news. And what's going on in the world.
Right.
Oh, do you have a certain station you like to watch when you watch it
or,
Yes.
We like channel eight.
Do you?
We like it.
It's the best.
Um, channel five for some reason has always been the one I watch.
Is that been your favorite?
Uh-huh.
I, I don't know
it's probably the anchors.
They just kind of catch you.
I don't, I don't know.
Yeah,
I very
and I thought it was very interesting, uh,
channel nine watching it when the murders were in Killeen
Uh-huh.
and, and going on.
They were having news coverage
and,
The C N N, is that what that is?
No,
it was channel nine.
Huh.
And, you know they have that hour that nine to ten of an evening.
Oh.
And so we had the T V on
and we were trying to catch all of it,
and they were showing some
and I was watching,
my husband and I were watching it,
and then we switched over to channel eight,
and the difference in coverage was unbelievable.
Yeah.
I can understand why channel eleven is, uh, you know, why they're kind of behind.
Yeah.
Did I say channel nine to begin with?
Yeah
That's why I wondered.
No
Okay.
No, channel eleven I meant.
I don't get that channel
Yeah.
I was thinking nine to ten.
Yeah,
yeah.
But channel eleven,
That is if you, if you want to go to bed early
it's nice to, to, to watch that early news sometimes,
Uh-huh.
so.
It, uh,
but the coverage wasn't near as good as when we, you know, switched over to channel eight
and they didn't

All right,
well do you play any musical instruments or,
No,
I don't play any.
I used to.
Oh well,
I think everybody took piano lessons
so,
Everybody,
sure.
I, I started when I was in, uh, third grade,
and I've, I still play the piano as of today.
Do you?
Yes,
I do.
I started,
I think I was in the fifth grade
and I played it for maybe three months
But, then, again, I was also in, uh, the marching band.
I played the drums,
I played the clarinet,
I played the trumpet.
Wow
Uh, you know, whatever
and so I, I still sing,
and I sing in the choir today
so,
All right
I I enjoy the music,
it gives me an out.
Yeah.
It always sounds like,
for my playing the piano when I was depressed and didn't have anything else to do and there was no one to play with I could always go play with the piano, you know.
True
So, how long did you play?
Only for about three months.
Three months.
Yeah,
me and my brother both took the classes
and we got pretty bored quick
I was going to say, you got as far as the, uh, chop sticks, huh.
Um, well, I could play, uh, the wood chuck song.
Oh, the wood chuck song
And I still can to this date.
And your mother's saying, and although, the money that we spent for those piano lessons this is all we got was the wood chuck song
Yeah.
Yep,
they went out and bought us a piano
and for three months
Oh, bless your heart.
Did you ever, did you ever just bang on it or do anything with it at all.
Oh, yeah,
any time I got bored
Oh, okay,
but I mean, can you play anything on it, other than wood chuck song?
No.
No.
And Jaws,
but I think everybody can.
Okay.
I I, I can still read music if I'm lucky
because I,
if I work real hard I can still barely read the music,
but, see, I played the piano from the third grade all the way through high school,
Yeah.
so
Yeah.
I played uh, concertos and other stuff
but,
I got to the point where I wasn't really reading music, I was memorizing music,
so because of that, I can't read music as well as I used to,
but anyway,
Yeah.
but I enjoy it, though.
I find it to be a good out
and I still enjoy the marching band
and I still enjoy, uh, singing in the choir
so,
Do you sing at choir at your church?
Yes,
I do.
Yeah.
Yes,
I do.
That's,
in fact, that's about the only musical thing that I still do is sing in the choir.
Yeah.
I tried out for choir when I was, think, in the seventh grade
and they wouldn't let me in.
So, I never tried again.
Well, I sing in the choir,
I do know if they want me to or not,
but at least I do sing in it
Yeah,
That's pretty good.
Well,
I never really learned the music or anything.
I never learned,
I got right to where I was figuring out where all the keys were on the piano
and that's about when I quit.
I was at,
I actually went to the University of Texas at one time thinking that I would, be a musician.
I wanted to be a high school band director.
Yeah.
But after one semester of that, I said no, no,
this isn't for me.
enjoy it, but not for profession, no.
Yeah.
And besides that I kind of learned I wasn't really that good
I gave up.
Yeah.
Course, my mom thought I was,
but, uh, you know,
Of course,
parents always do.
Oh, yeah,
so,
They're nice that way.
Yes.
Well, what else can we uh, talk about,
uh,
Uh, well, I don't,
so you listen to kind of church music, gospel?
No,
no,
I, I listen to K V I L.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah.
So I listen to the radio,
I like the pop music.
Oh, yeah.
I like people like Neil Diamond and all, all the folks that you're not supposed to like,
but that's who I go for
Oh, yeah,
the jeezer music as I call it.
Oh, the jeezer music.
Yeah.
Oh, okay,
well,
My boss listens to that.
We listen to ninety-seven point nine
and that's his station, so I call it the jeezer music.
Okay,
now what kind of music do you listen to?
Well, I listen to like ninety-seven point one, you know, more,
What what is that?
It's more, uh,
I don't know how to explain it,
kind of pop, you know, rock.
Rock.
Yeah.
Hard rock?
Well, not hard
Not hard rock.
Just kind of,
Not like the eagle.
Huh?
Is that the eagle?
Yeah.
Okay,
I know, I know what the eagle is.
It's not too hard,
it's,
That's not too hard.
You know.
But it's not enough to put you to sleep
True,
true.
Which some of the songs on K V I L can.
Well, course, see, I listen to K V I L for the contests.
I mean
Oh, yeah,
got the bumper sticker, too?
Oh, yes,
oh, yes.
You can't drive a car without bumper sticker
and you know they're going to call you up.
Someday.
Yeah
Well, listen, I've enjoyed talking.
I, I'm sure that the switchboard will probably give us that sign off message very shortly anyway.
Okay.
I appreciate it.
Okay.
Catch you later.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.

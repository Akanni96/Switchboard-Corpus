All Right.
Ladies, first.
Oh, no.
Well, I don't find a lot of time to watch T V.
And a lot of time, I find it during the day when, when I'm rocking my little girl to sleep,
so I watch a lot of reruns, old shows, Like DICK VAN DYKE, all those old crazy shows.
Yeah
I really enjoy watching ANDY GRIFFITH.
Well,
so your a homemaker?
Yeah.
I guess, that's, the right term nowadays.
Yeah.
I guess so.
Yeah,
I am.
I stay home with two kids.
Yeah.
My wife,
we have a new one in the house
and she stays home, too, also.
Huh-uh.
Um, I guess, I have a wide variety.
I like watching the T V for things that are interesting,
not so much the things that aren't,
for example, like the COSBY SHOW to me is just kind of like a waste of my time, and DIFFERENT STROKES.
Huh-uh.
But I like SIXTY MINUTES, PRIME TIME LIVE.
Huh-uh.
Of course, I have to watch cartoons on Saturday morning, but not the NINJA TURTLES.
I like the old-timey ones, TOM AND JERRY.
You sound like my husband.
There you go.
He likes TOM AND JERRY and, uh, BUGS BUNNY AND ALL HIS FRIENDS. And all those guys.
Right.
JOHNNIE QUEST. the good ones.
Yeah. Yeah.
Um, now if I'm ever home during the, during the day on a vacation day, I have to catch at twelve o'clock the ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW, because I usually, because he's just, he's one of my idles.
And then, uh, but I don't know,
it seems like nowadays everything is so electronic, you know, magnified and animated, that you can grab from the old style movies and old style shows a little bit more insight to family groupings.
Huh-uh.
Huh-uh.
And so, uh, now I do, with the COSBY SHOW,
I have seen it a couple of times
and, I do,
I like the show.
I just don't watch it. Because of the timing,
Yeah.
but, uh, some of the crap that's on T V nowadays, it's about .
Yeah.
I do watch the special shows that they come out with, the NOVA stuff. And, and, the nature shows.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But, I think there's enough out there to pick from.
I'm not,
we don't have cable to the point of, of the H B O or any of that stuff.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But, uh,
Well, I find myself watching just a whole lot of whatever is geared for children. Because, *two utts with two kids
Huh-uh.
and, you know, I don't want them watching something that I don't think they should watch
or, I used to be really hooked on ALL MY CHILDREN,
Sure.
Oh, me.
And I watched that for like, oh, ten or fifteen straight years,
Oh, no.
and then I had, well, you know, I'd eat
like at work, we'd have a T V or whatever.
And then, um, as my kids got older and started, you know, recognizing what was going on, I thought, this isn't really very good
So I gave it up.
Fifteen years.
Yeah.
Bet they hated that.
I watched, I had watched it since it started.
So,
Oh, goodness.
Uh, now I, I don't know who the characters are,
and, um, I'll turn it on every once in awhile
and I don't recognize anybody,
so I guess that's a good sign
Yeah.
Really.
I used to watch, uh,
I can recall,
this might age me, date me here, uh,
I can remember staying home, when I was five and six, and my mother watching the EDGE OF NIGHT.
Huh-uh.
Oh, yeah.
Well, see, you're probably about the same age as me because my mom watched the SECRET STORM, and the EDGE OF NIGHT.
SECRET STORM.
Well, I think they were back to back, and black and white.
Huh-uh.
Huh-uh.
I was just a youngster
and I was like, oh, my gosh.
Yeah,
we used to,
my mother watched all that stuff, too.
And AS THE WORLD TURNS. I think AS THE WORLD TURNS may, still on or not.
Still be on.
It was not too long ago.
Yeah.
Now they got a lot of other crap involved.
And so,
Yeah.
You're right.
I think some of the tones of the, the daily prime time is questionable,
Yeah.
And that could be, uh,
I have to agree with you.
Yeah.
You know keep them on the channel eleven, channel twenty one. The nature stuff, you know
Right.
Yeah.
We do,
and it's real interesting, too, the difference in my kids,
like um, my oldest loved SESAME STREET, And those kind of shows.
Huh-uh.
My younger one doesn't.
She's more into WALT DISNEY kind, you know,
we watch a lot of movies that we've got on V C, on tapes, and stuff.
Huh-uh.
She's more into the animated stuff, where my other daughter liked puppets and that kind of thing
so, But, um, we do a lot of kid watching.
Huh-uh.
Well, sounds like you got your hands full there,
and I do appreciate speaking with you.
Sure.
It was fun.
Have you gotten your catalog yet?
No,
I don't think so.
Yeah.
I just spoke with Jim.
I just got my in the mail *sp? mine
and it inspired me to make more phone calls
Oh, well, see I don't really.
I've had a few people call me,
but, I've never made one.
Oh, really.
Yeah.
I need to get brave
Yeah.
Give them your pen number. *sp: pin
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's what I need to do.
Have a good day.
Thanks.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.

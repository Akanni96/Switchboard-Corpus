Okay,
so you're into microwave cooking.
Yeah,
it's just, it's so easy nowadays, you know,
and it's, uh, especially when people are working just to come home and pop something into the microwave
and it be ready in just a few minutes
, yes,
and that's what we all are looking for, isn't it,
something that we can just cook in a hurry after we get off work.
Yeah.
I've gotten in the habit of cooking something big on the weekends so that I have leftovers all week.
All week.
Well, we've done that, too.
There's just my husband and I,
and he, he sometimes makes a huge spot uh, pot of spaghetti
Uh-huh.
and, you know, we're eating it for a week and a half,
and I kind of get sick of it after he
I know.
I try not to make too much.
It's just my husband and I, too
Uh-huh.
and I try not to make so much that it lasts more than that week
Yeah
but, uh, I usually, I usually like to make spaghetti or soup or chili or, you know, something like that or sometimes a roast,
Right.
but,
Right.
What's your favorite thing to cook if you're having a dinner party?
Um, I have a great recipe for sour cream chicken enchiladas
Oh, oh.
it's, it's really good,
I got it from a friend of mine that I used to work with
Uh-huh.
and, uh, every time I've served it, everybody just loves it.
Ooh,
that sounds delicious.
So that's, that's one of my favorite things to make.
Uh-huh.
What about you?
I end up with an old stand-by that we call Russian chicken, because it's so easy
Uh-huh.
and, uh, it
you have to cook very little to go with it, just some rice and some salad
and that's about it, you know.
Uh-huh.
Well, what do you put in it?
Uh, you make, you just take your boneless chicken breasts
and then you take and make a, a dressing out of, uh, Russian dressing, one bottle of that and a package of Lipton Onion Soup mix and three ounces of apricot preserves
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Ooh,
that sounds good.
and you mix it up,
and you just put it on the top of the chicken,
and then I cover the pan with foil and put it in the oven for about an hour
Uh-huh.
and then I take the foil off and let it brown takes about another twenty minutes
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
and it's delicious
Ooh,
that sounds good.
and it's so simple, because I can pop it in when I come in the door, you know, and then, uh, go about my business,
and by the time I've got everything else ready, the chicken's chicken's done.
Is done,
right.
So that's a real easy thing for me.
Yeah,
that sounds good, too.
Uh-huh.
I've got a, um, a great recipe for cheese cake.
Oh, really.
I don't know if you get SOUTHERN LIVING,
but
No,
I don't,
my mom gets that,
but,
they have one,
if you like to cook, they have,
every recipe I've tried out of that has been a really good one
Really.
and, um, you know, every month they've got all different kinds of recipes,
but, I got one in there about a year or so ago on cheese cake,
and it's just a regular cheese cake,
and then you can put raspberry, uh, topping on it
Uh-huh.
but inside the cheese cake, uh, recipe you put, um, lemon peel and orange peel
Um.
and it's just enough to taste it, you know, when, when, when you're eating the cheese cake,
and it is wonderful,
but it takes a long time, because you have to cook it for forty-five minutes, and then you turn the oven off, and you leave it in the oven for another forty-five minutes and then you open up the oven door and leave it in for another forty-five minutes and then you're supposed to, um, I think, chill it to room temperature
Um.
Oh, my goodness.
Uh-huh.
so sometimes I'll do that overnight, and then put the topping on the next day,
but it's, it's very good.
Well, I love cheese cake.
I have never been, I don't know, the ones
I have made I have not done that well with.
Uh-huh.
I like a baked cheese cake, you know,
I don't,
I have had a recipe that someone has given me that it's kind of like you just mix cream cheese and stuff and refrigerate it, you know
Right.
Yeah.
but that's not the same as a, a New York style cheese cake.
No
it's not.
And, uh, the recipes that I've used,
everybody will say, Oh, this is real simple,
and then I make it,
and it's, it's really not very good
Right.
but yours sounds good.
I bet that lemon and orange peel gives it a little bit of tartness.
It does,
and it, it, it is really good.
Um. Well, that sounds interesting,
so there's your good dessert for your dinner party.
Right
Are you into serving wines with your dinner party?
Oh, sometimes,
but I mean, I'm not a wine connoisseur by any means.
Me, either.
I wish I knew more about it.
I've been to, you know, some wine tastings up in Napa Valley
Uh-huh.
but, um, you know, and I learned a little bit about them then,
but you know what would be fun, they have some of those classes you can take
Uh-huh.
They would be, if you just had time to do it.
yeah,
and then there's places, um,
do you live in Dallas
Uh-huh.
okay,
there's places here that, um, offer,
I think it's like once a month,
you can go and, to a particular restaurant or whatever,
and you can kind of take a cooking class
Uh-huh.
and then you get to eat everything afterwards,
and then they also go into the wines, you know to serve with, you know, different types of of meals and that kind of thing,
Well, how neat.
Uh-huh.
and it sounds like it's a lot of fun.
We have some friends who've done that,
and they've really enjoyed it.
Um, well, I didn't even know they were offering that.
I guess I,
Yeah,
this place is called like Medina's or Messina's Kitchen or something like that.
Uh-huh.
Oh, well, I bet that would be a fun thing to do.
Yeah,
it, it sounds like, like it,

And, uh, what part of Virginia, uh?
Uh, I live down in the south western part of Blacksburg.
Blacksburg.
Okay,
I've been,
Uh-huh,
have you ever heard of Virginia Tech?
Sounds vaguely familiar.
V P I.
Yeah,
okay.
Yeah,
okay.
I, I hadn't been down in that part of the state really.
Uh-huh.
Okay.
Well, we vacation a lot.
How about you?
Quite frequently.
Uh, I wish we did
Well, we retired early
Oh, okay.
so, we're, we take trips pretty often.
Where all you guys go?
Well, we go to Maine every Fall
Uh-huh.
then that's kind of a family visit and a vacation all up and down the coast
Uh-uh.
and I have a daughter in Texas and one in New Mexico,
so we go out there
and we go to Florida
Uh.
and down, oh,
we were just out recently at the outer banks of North Carolina.
All these places that I've never been
Is that right
Where do you go?
Uh
What type of vacation?
well, it really depends,
I mean, uh, seems like I do a lot in the Midwest lately,
uh, my, uh, fiancee's family's from Wisconsin
Uh-huh.
and so we've been out there a couple of times
and, uh, I, uh, went to Purdue for a couple of years,
so I've gone up to Indianapolis on occasion to visit friends
Uh-huh.
and, uh, uh, I'm a real big baseball fan
so I usually try to combine it with, uh, catching a couple of games somewhere.
Uh-huh.
What club do you follow?
I'm, uh, I'm a big Red Sox fan,
Red
good,
but, uh, I, uh,
me too
uh, you're a Red Sox fan too?
Yeah,
uh-huh.
I usually try to catch whoever's in town though, I don't specifically,
I, you know, go to Cleveland to see them play,  the  Indians or the Red Sox,
Uh-huh.
uh, uh, that's about it,
we don't, I mean, we do a lot of little trips around here, uh,
and, uh,
Ever go up in Pennsylvania in the mountains
or,
Not that much.
We've gone out to, um, uh, a place in western Pennsylvania called Falling Water.
Oh.
Uh, have you ever heard of it?
I've heard of it.
I've never been there.
Yeah,
it's, it's really neat.
It's this house built on, on a waterfall
and it's, uh, really cool
Uh-huh.
Um, of course, we keep picking crummy weather to go out there,
uh,  the first time we went out there was, uh, the day after hurricane Hugo had come through
Gee.
So, I mean they, they didn't have any power
and it was really cold and, and rainy
and, uh, we went up about a year later
and it was better but not a whole,  lot  better
Uh-huh.
So, uh, where else did we go, uh,
we've gone to Richland, last year and, uh, had a good time,  down there.
Oh, did you?
Did you go,  to Williamsburg,
have you been down there?
Uh, my girlfriend has with her sisters
but I haven't been,  down  there.
Uh-huh.
Uh, I hear that's nice.
We're going to get down, probably down Norfork sometime this Summer,  just  to see why, catch a football game actually
Uh-huh.
We were down,
well, when we came back from the outer banks we came up due Norfork and spent the night there with a friend in Portsmith and then went to Williamsburg and spent a night.
Uh, spend a day and a lot of money
Yeah
Yeah,
I've heard, uh,
I'm not real interested in Williamsburg because of the, of the price attached,  to  it.
Yeah.
We just,
we,
I,
But it's a pretty neat down to just go and walk around, if you like to walk,
it's a good town to just,  walk  in.
Uh.
Uh, yeah,
we'll,  do that.
You can go,  to the buildings and not go in if you're not,
Oh, okay,
so I can wander around without,
Yeah,
you can wander,
it's a good town to wander in.
Oh, okay,
I just have it pay somebody to get into the buildings?
That's right.
Oh, okay,
I didn't know that.
Yeah,
I think, uh, they do the whole with, you know, paying,
Yeah.
they  really did throw away a lot of money to get, getting one thing or another,
Yeah.
but  they had a good time
so.
We really didn't do that really this time, we just, uh, visited around.
Uh, uh,
We've done it a couple of times
and that's enough for, uh, probably another twenty years.
Yeah,
I was, uh,
we use it live in California
and, uh, my, um,
up, up around San Francisco,
and, uh, there was one year when my father was, uh, my father's company was starting to do stuff down in Los Angeles,
so, my father was working down in Los Angeles for like, uh, six months or so,
uh, actually I think it was closer, I think to a full year
and, you know, we'd, he'd fly down there on Mondays and fly back on Fridays,
well, any time we had a school vacation or something like that we went down to Los Angeles,
so I saw, I went to Disneyland about five times,  in one  year
Oh
and I really have no great urge to go back now.
That's great as a kid though, isn't it, I mean,
Oh, it was great, because, uh, well, the times that were really fun were when, uh, we had vacation
but the kids in Los Angeles didn't
Uh-huh.
so we basically had one of the parks.
Right.
Uh, Disneyland, I mean there's still a lot of people at Disneyland,
but there was another, um, another amusement park down there, Busch Gradens, uh,
there was nobody there when we were there, we got, we won a log floating ride like five straight times,
we just get, get done with them and they go, oh, do you want to go again,
sure.
Have you ever,
you've never been down to Epcot at Florida and Disney
No,
I'd like to,  sometime
that's good,
but,
we, we really enjoy that,
we've been two or three times and probably go back again this winter.
Yeah,
I've never been,
the fartherest south I've been on the East Coast is Charlotte.
Oh.
So, I, um, keep wanting to get further,
you know, I thought I would go to Florida a couple Summers,  ago
Uh-huh.
but never did it.
Charleston is a really nice place to visit.
My, uh, my sister lives in Charlotte
and they've gone to,  Charleston  a couple of times and had a real good,  time.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
it's a real pretty place.
Uh, yeah,
one of these days we'll get down there, although I don't know when we're going to have vacation to do it
We're, uh, we're getting married in about,  a year
Oh, are you.
and,   our  honeymoon, we're going up to this, um, uh, place in Wisconsin called Door County,
Yeah.
it's up by Green Bay.
It's a place my girlfriend's also wanted,  to  go,
Uh-huh.
and, uh,
Is it on, uh, one of the lakes?
It's, um, uh,
I don't if you've ever seen a map of Wisconsin
but there's kind of like a little, a little thing sticking out, uh, in the Lake Michigan,
Uh-huh.
that's  Door County
Oh, okay,
yeah,
that would,  be  really nice.
So,
Yeah,
they call it the Cape Cod of the, uh,  the Midwest
Oh
so, uh, we're thinking that'll be a lot of fun,
Uh-huh.
she,  uh, she had this, uh, book of pictures from it that were really nice, kind of like a travel guide
Uh-huh,
sounds good.
so, uh, that should be a lot of fun.
Well, I don't know what our next trip will be, I guess our next,
well, I know what my next trip, I'm going to be a grandmother in July
Oh.
The first, the first one,
Oh, boy.
so my  next trip is going to be to Texas
Oh, that'll be fun
Yeah,
in the middle, in the middle of the Summer.
Well, yeah,
you won't even,  notice  it though
Well, they'll be air-conditioning anyway
so.
Is that, is that how you got into this, uh, this,  you  know, uh, data base?
Yeah,
my daughter's a temp at Texas Instruments,  and working  on this project.
Oh, okay.
Yeah,
I was, I was just,
I mean most of the people I've talk to are from, are from Texas,
Uh-huh.
so,  when I, you know, when I heard you were from Virginia I was like, oh, okay, there's somebody different,
and you said, oh, I got somebody down in Texas,
I go, okay, that the connection,  right there
That's it,
yeah
I talked to one in California,
I never asked him the other day how he was connected,
I don't think he was T I employee.
Uh, I, uh,
most people talk to Texas,
there's been a couple of other the people, uh, most of whom are like me that work in, in speech labs that are going to use data base,  eventually.
Oh, I see.
So, uh,  it was fun
I, actually yesterday, I ended up talking to somebody else from the same lab I'm in.
Is that right.
Well, we spent last week end in Charlotte with real good friends that had just,  moved  to back East from Oklahoma,
Oh.
Uh-huh.
and  she's, uh, working on this project too,
I mean she's talking on the project too
Uh-huh.
and, uh, we got back Monday
and I got a call yesterday
and it was her, on T I Network
Uh, that's neat.
I haven't, uh, I haven't had something like that happen, just, uh, just getting the one guy,  from  the lab.
Uh-huh.
Uh, you're sure have a nice town,
uh, my, uh, sister lives on Lake,  Norman, just,
Oh, does,  she,
that's nice out there.
Yeah,
uh, we keep wanting to get down there and visit them over the Summer
and it's,  never  really works out.
Uh-huh,
yeah,
it's real pretty.
Yeah
Well
Traffic , not much else we do for vacation really,
uh, just so we don't, haven't been able to take really.
Are you a golfer?
No.
No.
Me either.
No.
Are you guys,  golfers
No,
uh-huh,
or, uh,
no,
uh-huh,
nope,
not too much into sports.
Except our outside , though.
Just walking that's all
Oh, I don't think there are any, traveling that was in my early teens down in that area
and I'm know real sure there are, um,
No professionals
When, uh,
I was thinking I might be minor league
but,
Oh, there's one in Salem, Salem Rebels.
Yeah.
Salem Rebels,
Buccaneers.
Buccaneers.
Oh, okay.
Yeah,

I may be seeing them, um, in a town just west of here, Frederick has a, uh, has a minor league team that plays in the same league with Salem
and, uh, I think we may be seeing them this,  weekend
Oh,

Yeah,
I think they're out of town.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Uh, that's a nice little town actually, Frederick, uh,
I've never been up there.
I've never visited Baltimore.
I'd like to go just sight see a little bit sometime.
Oh, there's, there's some nice things in Baltimore, you know,
the Inner Harbor and the, uh, the Aquarium and all that are very nice.
Uh-huh.
Uh, they've just done a, uh,

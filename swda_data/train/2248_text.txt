All right.
Now, we used to be big time campers
but now we're not quite so much since the kids are involved so much in sports.
Uh-huh.
What type of camping did you do?
Well when we, before we had kids, we was in a motorcycle group, you know,
Uh-huh.
we went like twenty or thirty at a time.
We took, uh, just our little tents,
Uh-huh.
and we did it that way.
Then when we started having children we bought a camper. You know,
Oh, uh-huh.
and we did it that way.
Oh, how neat.
So, we've always enjoyed camping.
Uh-huh.
Well, I know I have, um, I just have a tent,
and the kids and I like to go out and camp in the tent.
Uh-huh.
And then I bought a van
and that way I can sleep in the van and be more comfortable
yes.
Now we have friends with a van,
Uh-huh.
and when they go on vacation a lot of times they'll just sleep in the van, you know.
Right.
Yeah.
Like one night
and the next night they'll stay at the motel, you know, or something like that.
Uh-huh.
And they enjoy it.
Yes,
I don't, I don't think I'm a real true, trooper, you know, when it comes, to camping.
Oh,
yeah.
Oh, me either.
All the bugs and stuff
But I, I try
I hate to be on all that stuff
But, but I try, you know, to, uh, to get out there and enjoy everything.
Oh, yeah.
But what was so fun though is that I had to take my son to the doctor this morning because he went out camping with some friends
and he got poison ivy,
Oh.
and it's all over him.
The poor thing, you know,
so, there's definitely hazards to going camping if you don't know what you're looking at
Yes,
yes.
Oh, shoot.
Oh.
But now, I enjoy it every once in a while,
I mean, it's not something I'd want to do real often.
Uh-huh.
I'm a sissy.
Yeah.
I either want to do it in the fall or spring.
Right.
Right.
You know?
Definitely when it's cool.
Yes.
Well, have you done much camping around Texas?
Well, not really because usually it's when we go off, you know, like for a couple weeks or so.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
It's usually like that.
Yeah.
Well, have you camped all over the United States?
Just about.
Wow.
Just about.
See now I haven't so that,
I bet you that's an experience there.
Oh, it really is.
Uh-huh.
It really is.
Uh-huh.
Also I said we mostly did ours before we started a family.
Right,
right.
It's a lot easier then.
Well, I know my parents like to camp a lot,
and they, uh, they've been going to Gulf Shores, Alabama. And, uh, which is really, really neat.
Oh, uh-huh.
They said they've got the white beaches and the sand,
Yes.
and it's not real populated so they can, they feel like they're in the outdoors and still close to the ocean.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, from what I understand from them it's really, really pretty there.
Oh.
I'd like to go anywhere.
You know, I just like to go.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
I really do.
Well, have you done much camping up in Kentucky and, and those parts, in the mountains?
No,
not really,
not that much.
Um, we've been, well, we've been to Wyoming, you know, and Kentucky and Montana and, you know, places like that.
But usually if we're with a group of people we really don't stay any one place very long.
Uh-huh.
You know, like if we're just going through and they camp one night and then head on.
Right,
right.
But now that we have children and we go every blue moon, I'd rather just go to Galveston. You know
Yeah
Oh, yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
Yes,
yes.
Yes.
But we're, uh, we're getting more into it
and we've done, uh, we've done quite a bit
and, uh, uh, the kids like to go out, you know, as often as they can.
Uh-huh.
Um, so that's good.
You know, they're, they're becoming enthusiasts then of camping.
Uh-huh.
It is.
My children really enjoys it.
They really do.
But by the time we really get a chance to it's July, you know,
Right.
and it's so hot.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
And our camper doesn't have an air conditioner.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah,
it's one of those pop-ups.
I'm sure you could put one in probably,
Uh-huh.
but we hadn't did that.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
Yeah,
well, that's really neat.
Yes,
Well,
we all enjoy camping.
And they're, you know, they're in like and scouts and stuff like that, you know, so, they get to go camping in those organizations also.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
At least their Daddy goes with them,
I don't, when they do that.
Yeah.
But, That really is.
Yeah.
Oh, that's neat.
That's really neat.
Well, how old is your boys, your children?
Well, I, well, I have, um, a son that's, uh, going to be eleven here pretty soon, and then a daughter that's thirteen.
Uh-huh.
So, they're, they're getting old enough to where they can help out with a campfire and, cooking and, and all that kind of stuff too.
Oh, yes.
Yeah.
Yes.
So, that's, that's really neat.
It really is.
Mine's eleven and eight.
Uh-huh.
So, they really enjoy it too.
Yeah,
yeah.
Yeah,
I, I agree with you.
They like to get out there
and, but this wasn't so fun this last time for Nathan to, to get out there
and he didn't realize he was touching poison ivy
and it got all into his eye
and it was really swollen
and, uh, so they had to give him shots and everything,
so.
oh, well, maybe next time he'll stay away from those particular trees, or what, bushes, whatever they are
Yeah,
yes.
Yes.
Oh.
But I have, uh, brother-in-law and a sister, you know, that just really just camp.
You know, they love to go camping.
Uh-huh.
They could, they would all the time they wanted, you know, wanted to because there's nothing holding them back.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
But I'm just not that involved in it.
No,
now I like to go out like several times a year.
Yeah.
But not on a, on the regular basis.
I have some friends who go out every single weekend, when, you know, in the season.
Oh.
Uh-huh.
Uh, and, and I just couldn't do that, you know.
Me, I haven't really as far as entertainment,
I don't know what you would do every you know.
Yeah,
yeah.
But I guess, my entertainment's, television, I guess
Just getting away.
Yeah,
right,
right,
see, I see, they just want to get away.
Uh-huh.
But every Friday night they'll go home, you know, straight from work
and they'll pack up
and, you know, and then they'll leave,
and I'm just going, you know,
by Friday night I just want to crash, you know,
and I want to go home and, you know, do all that, and then, uh, get out on the road to boot,
Oh, I don't either
so.
Uh-huh.
But anyway that's their life
Yes.
But they probably live in a city also,
don't they?
Yeah,
yeah,
that's true.
Well, see, we're in a real small county area,
Uh-huh.
and, you know, that makes a big difference.
Now that's true.
That's true.
Because if we want to go camping we can just go just a few miles, you know
Yeah
That's true.
That makes a difference.
Well, it was nice talking with you.
It was nice talking to you too,
Okay.
and we'll probably be talking to you again.
Okay,
well, take care.
okay,
bye-bye.
Bye-bye.

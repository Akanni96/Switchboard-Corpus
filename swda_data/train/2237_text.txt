Okay
So, do you have, do you have the long,
I guess not, not if there's,
see I was raised in New York,
but I guess up there you all don't have too long of a growing season, do you?
Uh, well, we probably have about three months, approximately.
Do do you do your own gardening?
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Do you.
We live on a,
used to be a farm,
but we don't farm much,
we, uh, but we do have a garden.
Huh. See I got mine in,
well, let's see,
I put in pepper plants this weekend.
Oh.
I wish I could be doing that
Yeah.
I got all my little seedlings coming up in the kitchen
and, I enjoy tinkering with it, you know,
Uh-huh.
it's pretty hot down here during the Summer,
we hit, you know, a hundred, hundred and two sometimes,
Right.
but, you know, we don't do too much during the Summer, as far as tomatoes and stuff, like that.
You almost have, to get started pretty early probably. I guess,
Yeah.
I can, usually I can put in, oh probably mid-March, I can put anything in the ground, you know, beets, and onions, and stuff like that.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
But then I have to wait for my,
tomatoes have to go in here in the next couple of weeks
Uh-huh.
as soon as we're, sure we're not going to have another freeze, go ahead finish it.
Yeah.
You've had more freezing this Winter, or this, yeah, Winter, I think.
Yeah.
We've, had just a few, you know, that freezes a little here and there,
More bad weather.
but every once in a while, we get a freeze around the middle of April,
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
and it's pretty tough.
Uh-huh.
Are you, do you work,
or are you retired
or you,
No.
I work, uh
Uh-huh.
I'm only forty years old.
I have to work,
Uh-huh
Uh, my husbands retired.
But he's not a gardener.
He, he, he's been helping me more,
but he really isn't, uh, real crazy about gardening.
Uh, I, I really enjoy it,
it gives me time outdoors,
Uh.
and, you know, I'm a golfer,
but, it gives me time outdoors, and time around my house,
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
and I, burned my grass off here in the last couple of days getting ready to start to the Spring season, and see if I can grow me another nice lawn,
Oh.
Uh-huh.
I usually have a pretty nice lawn,
it's a lot of work you know,
Oh yeah.
but it's,
But it's a pleasure to, like you said, it's good to get outside,
and and I like, I like my garden too
Yeah,
it is.
We didn't have to, we have just a small garden,
but we planted corn last year too, which takes quite a bit of space
Uh-huh.
we, we didn't have too good luck with it,
because the, uh, we had a couple of good, real good wind storms,
and it really damaged the corn
Oh yeah.
so we didn't get too much corn, last year.
We're going through that,
we going through the dust storms down here now,
uh, uh-huh.
so, but I, uh, what I did with my garden, is I have a, a two by six frame that's five by ten.
I have two of them sitting side by side
Uh-huh.
and then I put, uh, like, a black plastic,
it's really not a black plastic.
They call it Wedet
Oh.
Uh-huh.
and I put that down,
and then I put up a couple of inches of pine moss on top of that
Huh.
and I use a, one of those black poker hoses that actually oozes water every where
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
so I waste it up and down there a couple of times,
and I only have to water about two hours a week
Oh that's great.
and it's pretty nice.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Especially during the Summer, it keeps everything wet, instead of wilting.
Yeah.
We don't, we don't usually cover ours.
We did a few different times
sometimes we've covered with the plastic,
and other years we've tried newspapers
Oh.
and, uh, but we generally don't, we do our watering from our spring.
Oh you have a spring,
Yeah.
how nice.
We have an old fashioned pipe sitting, that, you know, water runs into
and, my husband set up a pump that runs,
Uh-huh.
it runs first down
and then it stops,
Oh that's, that's pretty nice.
and when the water comes up, it comes on again,
and we use that to water our garden with
so,
But you actually enjoy it, huh?
Oh I do.
I do.
Do you?
I love it,
Get out there on your hands and knees, and crawl around.
I'd rather be doing that, than housework
I, I can imagine.
You all have much trouble up there, with insects
or,
Uh, not a well, not a whole lot.
I think our cabbages, and broccolis and that in we have more trouble with, that type of thing, with the, the,
With the worms?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I have quite a bit of problem down here with the squash bugs, and haven't figured out how to get rid of those yet.
Uh.
Uh-huh.
Do you go more for natural, keeping them off naturally,
or do you, use insecticides?
Yeah,
I try to,
no
I, uh, uh, try not to use any insecticides at all.
I try not to even use insecticides on my lawn,
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
but, I, sometimes I can't manage.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Well, our lawn, is, is a big lawn because, because we live out in the country,
and so we were not, our lawn is not perfect, you know,
it's just the it's just a lawn
Yeah.
Well, mine's full of dandelions, now,
Uh-huh.
so,
Do you eat any of them?
No,
I never have.
I don't know how to prepare them.
Oh, did, well, did, does your wife ever make, uh, bake in a hot bacon dressing, like for, salad?
No.
Huh-uh.
Oh it's delicious
and it goes real good on dandelions.
Really.
Uh-huh.
Huh.
I've never eaten dandelions
now I've tried dandelion wine
Uh-huh.
but I've never tried any dandelions just to eat.
use the greens, if you get them when they're young and tender, you know, before they have grown too, too tall,
Yeah.
because they do get a little stringy.
All right.
But, uh, they're kind of fun to, to try,
Yeah.
get a, get a few
and then throw them in with the rest of your salad sometimes.
I'll try that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I sure will
Uh, but I've been cutting our grass too lately because my husband's back,
and he's been having trouble with
so, wasn't allowed to run a lawn mower,
Oh, Oh.
so, it takes about four hours to cut our grass.
Yow.
And, we have, we have hills.
I'm afraid of the hills
but, I'm getting on to it,
So you all are into, so you all are into the lawn, big time, huh.
I just pretend they're not there,
and I just go ahead and do it
Yeah.
Yeah,
I only get, well, I guess I got
my, my whole section of my house is probably a tenth of an acre
Uh-huh.
then I have a pretty nice backyard,
Uh-huh.
and you know, I've got enough room to throw horseshoes. You know, couple of other ,
Oh, that's great.
great.
That's, a lot of people don't have that much space even.
No,
and it's nice.
I'm just inside the city limits,
I'm probably a mile, mile and a half inside the city limits,
and I'm only a mile, and a half from work.
Uh-huh.
So you have all the conveniences of, a city,
Yeah.
It's pretty nice.
yeah,
and, and the country also.
I have the room outside I need,
and I don't really have all the room in the house I need
but,
Well, you never have enough room do you think. Especially if your into any hobbies or anything.
No.
I have a question to ask you about gardening though.
You know, those,
what are they called,
the, they called, uh, rolly polly bugs,
that's what my son calls them anyway.
Rolly Polly what?
Rolly Polly bugs.
The ones that roll up in a ball.
I don't know what they're called.
Is it a bug, You mean?
They look like they've got,
Yeah.
A worm?
Yeah.
A cutworm?
No.
Not a grub worm?
It's not like a,
no.
You find them under bricks and all that stuff, where it's moist,
and if, if you touch them, they roll up in a ball.
Oh.
I don't know what they call them.
But I'm plagued with those things,
Uh.
and I haven't figured out,
I even called the nursery,
Uh-huh.
I'm trying to think of what they are, what kind, they could be.
I, I don't know.
You find them under bricks usually, and that.
Yeah,
under bricks, or under wood,
or you know, if you leave a piece of newspaper in the yard too long, they get in there.
They usually come out at night,
but, you can find them during the daytime if you pick something up that's been laying around,
They're not a slug.
No.
Not a,
A slug is actually kind of slimy
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
and these are just,
he plays with them all time,
he picks them up and rolls them across the patio.
Oh really.
They were not hard are they?
No.
Are they a hard worm?
No.
They're not real hard,
They're not a hard .
They're like a, water bug, of sorts,
Huh.
I don't know what, they're called.
Oh, are they black then?
Yeah.
Yeah.
But they roll up.
Yeah.
I can't think of what kind they would be.
When you touch them, they roll up.
Uh-huh.
I'm no help on that, then. Because, I can't think of what they are. What they would be.
But, I'm plagued with those.
I think you have a lot more insects down there even than, than what we have.
You know, I think it's a big problem because we're in more of a tempered zone.
You know, we don't really, we only freeze down here in January, and February, at the most.
I know, my brother had trouble with fire ants, and that even.
You know.
Yeah.
I got fire, ants too.
Uh, yeah.
And they be can be a real dickens.
And, you, spray in one part of your lawn,
and they just move to, another part.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
So you got to, spray your whole yard,
Yeah.
Yeah.
and your, your, your neighbor gets them,
and then he sprays his yard,
and you get them back again
Yeah
you keep trading them
Yeah.
But we're not doing too bad down here really, you know,
the daffodils are out
and,
Uh-huh.
Ours are going to be coming out.
Now our cancer society sales daffodils.
Right now, they're, they're big now.
So, we, we have daffodils, here in the house because of the cut flowers,
Yeah.
Yeah.
but they're just beginning to come out and bud.
Yeah.
See mine are up and bloomed already
so,
Uh,
already.
Uh-huh.
They sure are, pretty,
uh,
uh-huh.
I like them ,
uh, they're such a nice bright early Spring, color.
yeah.
And then in, in my back flower bed I have, uh, tiger lilies
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
and they bloom in, you know, late June, mid, July.
Uh-huh.
And they're, beautiful too.
Yeah,
they are.
They real, beautiful.
They're beautiful.
They're, they're nice and green, you know,
they're, uh, they're up above a foot, maybe eighteen inches.
Oh my.
They come up real pretty, every year, no problem.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We won't have too much here for another couple of months yet.
Is it still pretty cool up there?
Yeah.
Yeah.
We're it's raining today.
Well, do you all have a,
what kind o grass do you grow up there?
Do you grow, uh, Bermuda or ,
Well, our grass, like I said is just grass.
We really didn't plant anything.
It's just,
Yeah.
I suppose maybe you call it crabgrass even.
Yeah.
And, uh,
See we, I have Bermuda, in my yard,
Uh-huh.
and I still have the old standby crabgrass here and there,
Uh-huh.
but, Bermuda seems to be,
It's probably, very pretty.
Yeah.
Bermuda seems to be pretty, good down here.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
We have some people that have done their lawns,
and, uh,

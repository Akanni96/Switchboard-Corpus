Well, Nancy, what do you think, um, some of the changes in roles of women are in American society in the past generation or two?
Well, of course, working.
Uh-huh.
That's definitely got to be the biggest thing, is that everybody's out there working including me
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Well, what do you think it is?
Um, yeah,
I agree.
Yeah.
I also think that there are more, um,
the people are,
women stay single longer it seems like.
Yes, they do.
Yeah.
Yeah,
they do.
I know  my mother and her sister were both married by the time they were twenty
Right.
and I waited until I was thirty-two,
so.
Uh-huh,
yeah.
You know, um, I know that.
Yeah,
that's true.
It's a big change.
I'm an O B nurse
and so I really do see what you're saying there.
Uh-huh.
It used to be that our list ran nineteen, twenty, twenty-one for our patients' ages.
And now our care plans look more like thirty-two, thirty-three
Uh-huh.
and if we get somebody twenty-one, we go, oh, look how young.
Yeah.
So, yeah,
you're right there's a big change,
and we have a lot of first time moms in their late thirties and even forties.
Uh-huh.
So, it's true.
Yeah.
But again, I guess it probably does go back to the same thing of women having careers.
Uh-huh.
If they didn't have,
if they weren't out there working and having their careers they probably would be married and having their children
Yeah.
So.
Yeah,
yeah.
Seems like there's.
I guess it's a combination.
Uh-huh,
go ahead.
No,
go on.
Uh, it just seems like there are more single mothers, too.
I mean, that's,
there're a lot of, either divorced or, um, you know, never been married,
Yeah.
so.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
there's a lot of mixed up families, that's for sure.
Yeah,
I agree.
Well what do you think have been the most significant changes in the past generation or so?
Well, just that.
I think the families,
the, the role in the family,
and the mother doesn't stay home and cook the dinner take care of the children, um,
Uh-huh.
we do it all
Yeah.
I really think that,
and I know that there's a lot more participation by the fathers,
but I still think the mothers have the major role.
Uh-huh.
I really do.
I think they're just, they're not doing very much less,
I don't think as far as the kids and, and the house and everything are concerned, not from what I see
Yeah.
Yeah.
and, and they're contributing to the income besides.
Uh-huh.
I think that we're really, really putting a lot of stress on ourselves.
Uh-huh,
yeah,
and it really, it's affecting the families you know, for mothers not, not to be home, and yet, you know, um,
I mean, I, I don't blame anybody when they have to work because, um,
yeah.
Yeah,
it's, it's difficult,
and I think that,
I live in Plano actually,
so
Uh-huh.
it's a very wealthy town,
and we're not part of that,
but, it is, you know,
and, I think what I see a lot of parents, a lot of mothers working just for bigger and better
Uh-huh.
and I really hate that you know,
Uh-huh.
I hate to see that,
and I, I've been here for a very long time
Uh-huh.
but, um, I don't know,
now I'm a single parent,
and I don't have a choice any more
Uh-huh.
but I used to just work occasionally for extra money,
but now I have to work all the time
Uh-huh.
and that's really hard
Yeah.
and, and I don't know how a mother does just choose to go out to work, and, and leave the kids.
In a way it's good, it's very good to get out with adults,
and I think that's a good thing, if you can do it part time.
Uh-huh.
But to just go out there forty hours a week, at least and and work and, and leave your kids to get home from school alone, and that kind of thing, I think that's not very smart.
Yeah.
I think that's difficult on them.
Uh-huh.
So.
Yeah.
Well what do you think's going to happen in the next generation?
You think it'll continue?
Well, it's going to be interesting.
Yeah.
Yeah,
I think it will change,
but I'm not sure how it's going to, because you see young people today and wonder how in the world they'll ever afford to buy a home and and to raise a family.
Uh-huh.
I don't know how they're going to do it.
Uh-huh.
And so I don't know how it can change to where the mother can get back into the home again.
I don't that ever will go backwards
Uh-huh.
but I don't know what effect it's going to have on these kids now when they grow up, how they're going to feel about it.
Uh-huh.
It, you know, it could lead to another Woodstock type thing, you know, where where there's just too much material things,
Yeah.
and, and maybe these kids will really resent that their parents are out there working for things
Uh-huh.
and they might want to do without things rather than do that to their families.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
It's hard to say.
Yeah,
it is.
I think some,
I don't know how many, you know, what percentage, but some are, will move back toward more traditional lifestyle of staying home with the children.
I guess I see that happening already.
Uh-huh.
Some choosing it,
and, and they get, you know,
there're,
people chide them for it, you know,
why aren't you out,

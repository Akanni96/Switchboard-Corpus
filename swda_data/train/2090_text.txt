Okay,
I guess its recording.
Um, what kind of hobbies do you have?
Do you sing or knit or anything?
Well, I, um, I do cross-stitch
and I enjoy reading and playing softball.
Okay.
I, uh, I started knitting awhile ago,
I knitted
I didn't know, even know what the stitch is called.
I just had this, uh, uh, piece of yarn
and I wanted to start something
so I remembered something I learned I think when I was five years old
So I kept doing that,
and now I have a little blanket
but that's all I've done.
Oh, really.
Uh.
Well, I know that I learned how to knit one time and, um, made a few things
but I haven't done it in so long that I probably wouldn't remember how
Do you make sweaters and things or just blankets?
Well, if I remember I think we made some, like Christmas stockings,
you could make the, like the granny squares or whatever, and sew them together and make Christmas stockings and maybe some slippers or something like that.
Uh-huh.
Oh.
I see.
Nothing as big as a blanket.
Huh.
I know that my husband's grandmother does a lot of that.
Uh-huh.
And she makes a lot of afghans and all that kind of stuff
but,
I probably won't make anything beyond this blanket
I don't know why.
It's just too time consuming.
Yeah,
do you have any other hobbies?
Um, I like to sing.
I've been trying to get some wedding gigs and things like that.
Oh, well that's good.
Um, right now my actual job is a news reporter.
But, uh, if I could do anything I wanted to do, it would be to sing professionally.
But um,
So are you on the T V then?
Yes,
uh-huh.
Oh.
I'm in, uh,
I work for channel six in Waco.
Oh, okay.
And so I do little news reports and things.
It's not as exciting as it as it sounds.
But, um,
So you don't have too much time for hobbies?
No,
not much,
um, my day is usually pretty full.
Yeah.
My schedule is like from nine to five thirty,
but I could be at work from anytime, you know, from nine until nine at night or ten or whatever,
so it's hard to make plans much less, you know, have a hobby.
Yeah
so. What do you do?
Um.
Normally.
I'm a housewife.
Oh, okay.
So, unless the kids are asleep I don't get, usually get much done either
Uh-huh
But I've made a, um, few things, cross-stitch things.
I really enjoy doing that.
Uh-huh.
And um, I made, uh, like stockings for both my children and a Christmas tree shirt and that, type of thing,
Oh.
and it just takes a long time to get it done
but, you know, once you've done something like that it kind of makes you feel good, to, to see it.
Right.
I I showed mine to my boyfriend
and he was like, you didn't make that.
Really?
Oh, yeah,
it looks, uh, halfway decent
actually, first thing I did
I guess you can make baby blankets that wouldn't take as long
How many children do you have?
Two.
Oh, okay.
I hear them in the background there .
Yeah
All right,
that's a hobby in itself.
Not quite
A job in itself.
It's a fulltime job,
yeah.
Right now I was just sitting here watching T V,
I was getting ready to fall asleep.
So, um, have you sang at any weddings yet?
Yeah,
I sang at one last summer.
Um, it was my first wedding.
I've done, um, little commercials and background singing
and, um, I sang all through college and things like that
but I really haven't done anything really, professional per se.
Uh-huh.
But I did one wedding last year
and, uh, I just now got some cards together, kind of, uh, business cards that say, singer,
Uh-huh.
and what does it say, a song makes beautiful wedding or something,
and I've been passing them out to different wedding shops,
I mean when someone comes in, you know, for a wedding, for a wedding dress, and they, they might ask about it.
Oh, that's a good place,
yeah.
Uh-huh.
This one woman even wanted me to bring my tape in because I have a demo tape, you know, if any one wants to listen.
Yeah.
And, uh, she wanted me to bring it in,
she's going to play it on Saturday
so that would be great, if someone came and heard it, and they were like, I want that voice,
Yeah
but, I haven't got any calls, yet
Well, that's good.
but I only just put them out this week
Yeah.
and it's the wedding season, I guess.
Oh, that's true.
Uh-huh.
Make your hobby into a business, that would be pretty good, huh?
Yeah,
that would be great.
Then I could be getting paid for something I love to do.
Yeah
Not that I don't like reporting,
but, I'd love it.
Did you have training in singing when you were, younger then
or,
No,
I've never, I've never had, uh, formal training.
I've just been singing every chance I get.
I try, you know, in school
Choirs and that kind of stuff?
and, yeah,
choirs
and, um, when I was at U T, I was in a group called Ensemble One oh Nine, just twelve singers
and we did, uh, little conventions and, um, uh, like dinner parties and things like that.
Huh.
Sing pop music.
Well, that's nice.
So, that's what got me really, really interested in it.
Uh-huh.
So I'm trying to be sensible, sensible, too, at the same time.
Yeah,
not just give up your job and jump right into it
Yeah,
exactly.
My parents would have a fit probably.
But, uh, I think,
I either have a call or,
yeah,
I do have a call,
hold on one second.
Uh-huh
Hello.
Yes.
Yes,
okay
that's my mother on the other line,
I need to go,
Oh.
but, um, I think we are suppose to talk for ten minutes
are we suppose to hear a beep or anything?
I don't know,
I've only done this one other time
and I thought that the man told me five minutes.
Oh, okay,
my mother said ten minutes
so, I don't know.
Oh, okay.
But, uh,  okay
well, it was nice talking to you
and,  and good luck with your hobbies
It was nice talking to you, too,
good luck with your singing.
Okay,
bye.
Thanks,
bye.

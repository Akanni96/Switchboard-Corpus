What kind of a car do you drive now?
I drive a Honda Prelude.
Do you?
I drive a Honda Accord.
Oh, yeah
Yeah
I bought mine a year ago
so I'm not buying a car any time soon.
Yeah,
me either.
I just bought mine, uh,
it will be a year in August.
Yeah.
I love it though.
I love Hondas.
Yeah.
It,
I think I found my car.
Well, I, I like where all the controls are they're, they're in good spots
Right.
Oh, really,
Yeah.
I have a standard.
But, um,
I,
it's, an it's supposedly real reliable
the only thing I've ever heard about Hondas is that the breaks go out first.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
I hadn't heard that.
Yeah.
What did you have before you bought that.
I had a Buick Regal.
Did you?
Yeah.
I had, uh, a Mazda R X Seven before that
and that was the worse car I've ever driven in my life.
The Buick was, was great.
It was nine years old
and it, was still going strong.
Really?
The only problems I had with it in the nine years that I owned it, I had to replace the compressor when it was about seven years old.
Really?
And that was the only major problem that I had, I mean,
I had like little piddly things like I had to replace the muffler
Yeah.
and I had replaced the tires
and, uh, seems like it had a radiator leak once.
But I never had any major anything, other than the compressor.
Right.
I really never had anything major with my Mazda
but it was a standard also
and the clutch went out on it toward the end,
I had it five years
and the last year, last two years it seemed to go out really easily.
I think it went out twice in two years
and that's, that's a lot
it shouldn't go out that much.
Huh-uh.
And so I went ahead and bought another standard when I bought the Honda
but I don't think I'm going to do that again.
I think I'm going back to automatic now.
Well, I never, well,
I kind of know how to drive standard
but I've never owned one
so I hadn't, I don't drive one a lot.
Right.
So, I don't feel comfortable in traffic with it.
Right.
And for everything I've heard it's a lot easier to sell an automatic.
Yeah,
it is.
And, and resale value is really important to me
That's true.
Yeah,
it is me too
that's why I got the Honda.
Yeah.
Hondas have great resale value.
Yeah.
The Mazda definitely did not
Not at all.
They're worse than American cars I think or just as bad as far as resale goes.
I did pretty well with my, uh, Regal because it was in really good shape
but, it still looked real nice,
Yeah.
the, the interior was still really nice,
there wasn't cracks all over the dash board and stuff.
Right.
And it had some, some nice features.
So I ended up okay with the Buick,
Good.
and I anticipate the same thing with the Honda whenever I decide to sell it,
of course, I may never sell it
Right.
I may drive it until it's dead
but,
Yeah.
That's what I did with the Mazda, drive it until the, until the clutch went out and the wheels fell off,
Yeah.
so, probably what I'll do again.
Yeah.
But I really like the Hondas.
I like foreign cars a lot.
Uh-huh.
Well,
I looked at the Mitsubishi Galant.
I was looking for a four door car having driven the R X Seven so long,
Uh-huh.
and it was so small
and it's really impractical.
So, I wanted something with a real trunk, and four doors something easy to get in and out of
and I looked at the Galant
and those were really nice
and I can get them for a great price.
Yeah.
But I found it hard to deal with the, the dealership I was going through.
Oh.
So, that's how I ended up with a Honda.
I wasn't even looking for a car when I bought this car.
I, uh, I was thinking about buying a Prelude from a friend who was moving to New York or something
so and she was going to sell her car because she didn't need it anymore
and it was only like a year old
and I had never driven, uh, a Prelude.
So, I went to a dealership because they had like, uh, the same year and same model, of Prelude on their used car lot
Right.
and I went and I test drove it
and, you know, I just fell in love, with this brand new white Prelude, uh, you know, two liter S I with the sun roof and the moon roof
Oh, yeah.
They're nice I think.
and I, bought it loaded.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
I have to have them loaded,
Oh,
um, I love all those little things that you don't need
but they're so wonderful.
Yeah.
I went there looking at a used car
and two days later I bought this car.
I felt like, I felt like that was the worst impulse, that was, that was largest impulse that I, that I had ever made.
The the two, other things that I bought on impulse are a V C R and a washer and dryer.
I understand.
I go for the big stuff.
Yeah.
I noticed
Mine was definitely not impulse
I really needed a new car.
Mine was just, it was getting worn out I guess from being a sports car.
I drove it kind of hard,
Oh.
and I got it right after high school.
So, by the time I traded it in it was ready.
Yeah.
I got, I got my Buick as a high school graduation gift.
Did you?
Yeah.
But I, I guess this wasn't really an impulse, I mean,
buying it right then and, you know, right quickly was kind of impulsive
but I'd been thinking about buying a new car for about three years
and I was just scared to.
Right.
I was scared to start taking on payments because the Buick was long since paid for.
Right.
That's the same with me.
Would you ever buy a used car for a new car for yourself?
Buy a, you, buy a used car?
Like,
Right.
Sure.
I, I was going to buy one once
but I just, I worry about who's driven them and what they've been through and the warranties and things like that.
Yeah.
Just, I can't seem to get over that.
That just bothers me
I don't know why.
Well, um, like on Hondas they,
supposedly, the maintenance records was supposed to be registered with Honda or whatever
and you can request whatever maintenance records exist on cars
and you can have them checked out by mechanics and stuff.
Yeah,
that's true.
I mean they can't stop you from doing it.
Hoping that they do go to a Honda dealership to get them serviced.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, and even if they didn't, you can still get a good idea from a, if you can get a good mechanic to, check it over real carefully and check the block and everything.
Yeah.
That's true.
So.
Well, I guess that's all.
Okay.
Well, I enjoyed talking to you.
I enjoyed talking to you.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.

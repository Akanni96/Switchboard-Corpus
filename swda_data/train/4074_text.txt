Dave.
What kind of pets do you have?
Oh, we have one rotten cat.
One rotten cat
Yeah,
it's my son's cat.
I heard a laugh in the background.
Yeah,
that's the boys.
They know I don't like it.
Don't you like cats?
Well, I like cats.
This, this cat is a, uh, more like a dog.
Oh yeah.
Yeah
he's, uh, a one owner.
He likes one boy in the family and that's about it
That's odd.
How does he treat the other people?
Just, uh, stays away or runs usually.
Wow.
But he follows, he'll follow my oldest son around.
You know when he is in the house, he will come up and he'll jump on his lap,
but if anybody reaches over to pet him or whatever, he'll just kind of look at them like what are doing.
Did he raise him or something?
He's, he, we bought the cat for him
and so he's, uh, been the one that you know spent the most time with him.
But I, I've never owned a cat like that.
I've had cats growing up all the time
and you know they are usually either that way with everybody or friendly to everybody
Uh-huh.
Huh, that's  interesting.
So,  it's a weird cat
Huh. We have a, a mutt.
A mutt.
Well, we, we named it Hooper because that's where we got it from.
Uh-huh.
Uh, some lady, she, uh,
a lot of people, uh, uh, drop off abandoned, abandoned pets at her house
Oh.
and she use to work for a veterinarian
so she would uh, neuter them give them all their shots
Uh-huh.
and we saw an ad saying it was free,
so we went down there and picked it up
and it's been an excellent dog,
but it's my first dog I've had
and we got it because my wife stays here at home  alone  while I go to work
Uh-huh.
so that's mostly why we got it. To keep her company while I am away at work.
So that, is that, is that kind of your child right now?
Uh yeah.
Right now  it, it is.
You feel like.
It's kind of good training.
I mean we have been trying for kids,
but right now we haven't had any,
Oh, uh-huh.
but it's pretty good training, I think really, keeps her on her toes
Have, have you had dogs before?
Uh, my brother has.
Uh, we didn't do a lot with them.
Uh, I never felt like it was mine or anything,
you couldn't do anything.
Uh-huh.
But, I mean, that did, did more responsibility. When its yours and not your brother's
Yeah.
But,
Well, I just, uh, we've, you know
when I was growing up I had, we always had a dog
and we had mostly mutts,
well not mutts, but mixes you know like one or two mix
Uh-huh.
and those dogs always seem to be the best dogs.
That's what we found.
Ours is, uh, like a cockapoo.
Uh-huh.
I think it's half cocker spaniel and half poodle.
Uh-huh.
But, it's a really good dog.
Yeah.
I don't know,
they seem to be, I mean, listen better or something.
Uh-huh.
Is your cat a purebred?
No.
No,
it's just uh an accident
From a uh, from my, my son's friend down the street.
They're their cat was an outside cat and just end up with some kittens
Uh-huh.
and so,
Would you ever want a dog in the family?
Uh, we, I would.
We, uh, we had a dog that was a, uh, mix between an Alaska Malamute and a Labrador
Uh-huh.
and, uh, I should say a pup
and he was just too big for our kids when we got him
Oh yeah.
and we, when we moved into our house that was the first thing we wanted to get was, uh, you know, was a pet
and it was a dog that we gotten
and he was, he was just too big.
Uh-huh.
Uh, the kids couldn't handle him
and I was still going to school
and my wife was working
and I was working
and so we just didn't have time to really train him
so he was kind of you know, he was too big for the kids to handle,
so he was just tied up to a post
Oh, yeah.
so we gave him to, uh,
I don't know if you've,
there is a place out here, uh, called Shorties Lane out here in Harrisville
Uh-huh.
and they have, uh,
I guess it's kind of an animal shelter
but he just takes a few the animals in
and some he destroys
and some he keeps.
Uh-huh.
So we took him up there
and he ended up keeping him.
Uh, cause he has had him for six or seven years.
We, we've, saw him just about a year ago
and, uh, I thought boy that sure looks like that pup we gave away
Uh-huh.
and so we asked him about it one day
and he said yeah,
he's been the best dog I've ever had in my life
Wow.
just goes everywhere with him.
I, he would have been a great, great dog.
He just needed a lot of time.

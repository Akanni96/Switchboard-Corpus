So what kind of weather have you had in Dallas?
Well, it's been very windy,
Really?
Yeah
see, I didn't, I don't,
I thought, uh, I thought,
I lived in Euless
and I thought it was pretty normal,
but anyway, but I guess you're right though it has been real hot,
because it, um,
I've had to use the air conditioner in March,
we've already had to use that,
my husband usually,
and we've had like,
I mean, this is probably typical though, uh, we,
like tornado weather and tornado warnings,
and, uh,
Uh-huh.
so, uh, you know, I, I forget from year to year.
I'm getting too old.
But, the, uh, it, the wind's blowing very hard,
Yeah.
but I guess, you know, we're just out of March, and, uh will bring the rain in, uh, April.
Yeah,
I know,
The trees are real pretty right now and everything.
And, uh, I don't know.
I know the pollen is real high,
Yes,
it is.
Seems very high.
It hasn't bothered me,
but I know that people that have allergies it seems to be pretty high.
I know.
It's been bothering me a lot,
but
yeah,
I think, I think the weather overall has been, um, probably like you said, probably a little bit warm
and, Uh,
A little bit warm and a little bit blowy, I think.
Anyway,
so we basically live in the same area
so it's real hard to,
Really hard to make too big of different comparisons, right?
I know.
Yeah.
I just think it's been warm,
and it's been hot,
and I liked it,
and it's beautiful,
and all the trees are pretty,
and I wish it would stay like this all the time
Yes,
I could stand this all summer.
So yeah,
I could too.
And, uh, gah, I don't think we can say anything else really.
I don't think we can either,
let's cut off.
Yeah,
that sounds like a good deal.
Well, you have a nice day.
You too.
And we'll talk to you later.
Bye-bye.
Bye.

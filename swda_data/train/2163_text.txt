Okay.
Okay.
I was trying to get my children quiet for a minute.
Okay. Yes,
a deep Well, credit cards, boy, that's an easy topic,
isn't it
it is
It's one we all hold dear and near, I'm sure.
Oh, yes,
yes.
I guess I've had some good experience and some bad experience with them.
Yeah,
most of mine's been pretty good, although I'm, I guess I'm like a lot of other people, now,
I'm trying to, to pay off my credit cards
and, and, uh, I've done pretty good at it.
Yeah.
Uh-huh
Well, I do fairly good until I go in the store and I see something I want You know not need, want.
Yeah.
Uh-huh,
there is a big difference
There's a big difference there.
Yeah,
yeah.
But most of mine that I use is strictly gasoline.
Yeah,
oh yeah,
I, I do that,
I do that,
but the rest, like I said, the rest of them I've been trying to, to pay off and, uh, get back on a cash basis, except for gas.
Uh-huh.
It's too easy to, to run into the gas station.
Oh, it sure is especially when you work out of town and everything, that way
And, .
Uh-huh.
At least that's for me.
Yeah,
yeah.
Yeah.
So.
But yeah,
I've, I've talked to some who's really had some bad experience
and kind of knock on wood I haven't yet, not bad.
Yeah,
well that's,
You know, I just, I'm just shocked at the end of the month, to see what damage I have did,
but I try to keep it pretty reasonable.
Yeah,
yeah.
Well, I've been pretty lucky in that respect.
I don't charge, like I say, I've, I been trying to, to not charge except for emergencies.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, so, but I haven't really had any bad problems with credit cards.
There's, you know,
they have, uh, wonderful features,
they're there when you need them. You know, like in emergencies, or whatever.
Yeah,
yeah.
And then they have bad drawbacks, too.  I mean high interest,
Yeah.
It's,  it's awfully easy.
it's like paying twice.
That's true,
that's true,
Yes,
so, .
I try to,
I did switch to one, uh, sponsored by the credit union, though. That seems to be a pretty low interest. Yeah, compared to some of the other ones.
Oh, uh-huh.
Yeah,
yeah.
And you don't have an annual fee there,
and that helps.
Oh, yes.
Uh, we used to have, you know, like several,
but right now, we're just more or less at American Express, you know,
Uh-huh.
and that way we can go ahead and pay it off when it comes in.
Yeah,
that's one way to do it, because that, that forces you to pay for it instead of saying, well, I'll just pay on it this month
Yeah.
Pay fifteen,
yeah.
and
Yes,
I know,
yeah.
Yeah.
And when you pay fifteen dollars a month it sure takes a long time.
Takes a long time,
that's right.
It sure does.
And now without the benefits of being able to deduct interest off, off your income tax that's, you know.
Uh-huh.
Of course it's been going down for a number of years,
but this is the last year you can take anything.
So.
Uh-huh,
yeah.
So.
Well, I've enjoyed talking to you.
Well, I've enjoyed talking to you.
And maybe we'll get to talk again.
Okay.
Okay,
bye-bye.
Bye-bye.

Are we tonight?
Yeah.
Sure.
Okay,
well let me go ahead and press one
Okay, Leslie,
I'd like to find out a little bit about your hobbies.
What do you like to do in your spare time?
Well, and when I have my spare time I do enjoy,
Actually, it's a cherished commodity now days, huh.
That's right.
Uh, I do enjoy, uh, sewing,
I hand, uh,
I do some needlepoint.
Oh, great.
And I, I've been doing a a picture for my father-in-law,
but if I, uh, ever get enough spare time, he might see it one day.
Uh-huh.
And some other things I like to do are, is music and, uh, also reading.
What kind of music?
Well I enjoy singing.
Oh, okay.
Yeah.
Well great.
I enjoy music too
and I, uh,
one thing that I like to do, uh, is sit down and play the piano.
I can't play that well,
Um.
I enjoy that.
Uh-huh.
Uh, a couple of hobbies that I also have is, uh,
I really enjoy bike riding
and the biggest hobbies I have right now are my kids and whatever they are involved in.
Yes.
Like my, uh, oldest boy is involved in soccer
so we go out and play kick the soccer ball around or play throw the football
and, uh, we also like to, uh, ride bicycles.
So we're riding bicycles
and so a lot of the hobbies that I have right now are centered around my, my children and also things that my wife and I like to do together.
Uh-huh.
And uh, so personally a lot of the hobbies I had when I was growing up and, uh, going to college and so forth are having to change.
Uh-huh.
I really enjoyed, uh, mountain climbing.
I really enjoyed skiing. Uh, and a lot of outdoor activities.
Uh there's not a whole lot of mountains here in Texas that I can go skiing with that right now,
That's right.
but hopefully I will be able to get back to the slopes some day
but,
Oh yeah.
I have not had the opportunity to go skiing
but, uh, I grew up in Arizona which has some mountains around it
but uh, never did get out and ski
Uh-huh.
You didn't?
No,
I never did.
Didn't have the, uh, I guess I didn't have the person out there saying hey let me take you skiing
and of course, I was at that you know stage of my life where I had to be taken to places.
I couldn't go by myself.
Yeah,
that's true.
That's true.
And then of course, once I got to the age where I could have done it myself, I had other interests I guess.
So
Oh yeah.
I guess that for me it was very helpful.
My two oldest brothers were very interested in skiing.
Oh yeah.
And so we, we went quite often
and, uh, in fact my brother still does a lot of skiing.
When I lived around in that area my brother would fly in from Chicago
and we would go skiing and enjoy that.
Uh-huh.
So, but, uh, luckily it's kind of unusual because hobbies, it's a, it's a nice thing to have
and it's good to fall back on those hobbies when you have time to. Like you mentioned
and I am finding out, a lot of the spare time that I had isn't there.
That's right.
It's, uh, it's, uh, taken up by activities with, uh, work, with family, with, uh, civic and Church responsibilities for me.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
So,
Yeah,
I, I find if I, I make I have to make myself realize that it is important to get out there and you know just even to go for a walk is good recreation for me
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah
Yeah.
And my youngest daughter is going to be starting up soccer
so she's real excited about doing that.
Well, great.
We will be busy with that again.
What, again.
So you have participated with that in the past?
Pardon me?
Have you participated in that  in the past?
Well, I  did with my older daughter
Uh-huh.
and she was in it for a few years,
but she has got so many interests herself that, we had to start eliminating
and well the first one to go.
She still likes her piano
Uh-huh.
and she is in band.
So, she's got lots of hobbies or, uh, activities going on.
It sounds like her life is full too.
Yeah.
I imagine your life is full taking them around all over the place.
Very much.
That's right
That's right.
All right.
All right.
Well, Leslie, it's been very nice talking to you.
Is there anything else that you would like to mention tonight
Uh.
or,
No,
I think we covered it pretty good.
Oh, okay.
Great.
Thank you for calling.
Well thank you
and you have a nice evening.
You too.
Bye,
bye.
Bye now.

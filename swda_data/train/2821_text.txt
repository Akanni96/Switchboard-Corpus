Are you still there?
Yes.
Okay,
it worked out fine.
Okay.
Well, we just ate out, um, had a big lunch actually because we both have been working late
and we had Italian, um,
have you ever been to the Olive Garden?
No,
I haven't,
is that good?
Yeah.
Well, do you really like Italian food?
it's not my favorite
but,  I like  it's okay.
Then don't,
Then this will probably,
I mean this isn't really excellent Italian food,
Uh-huh.
That sounds terrible to tell you to go somewhere where it's not that great
but it's, um,
you're not going to believe this
but I have to tell you this if I don't because you're in Plano,
That's okay.
but my,  um, softball unit here is acting like he's dying of tramane poison
It wasn't that bad,
actually it's very good it's all of these run adult males,
Uh-huh.
which I'm not Italian,
no,
it's , it's all the garlic bread and all the,  salads  you can eat with an entree.
Oh.
Oh, that sounds really good.
So it wasn't too bad it really wasn't
but I was more in the mood for french toast any way
so,  so  I really like Italian food though,
Yeah.
but do you have any favorite?
Well are there just the two of you?
Uh, yes,
uh-huh.
Okay,
well, when my husband and I go out we have four children.
Oh, you're kidding.
So that makes a difference.
For us when we go out with the kids obviously we want to go somewhere that we can,
the fast food ones are probably the ones they like the best.
Oh, sure.
But we don't like to go there because that's the most expensive,
so we like to go to a pizza place where you can buy a pizza for one price and feed the whole family,  and  like that.
Yeah.
You can usually get a variety of what you're looking for,  like  at Gatti's or something like that.
Right.
Right,
but when my husband and I go out we like to go somewhere with a little atmosphere
and we usually head on down, um, oh what's the freeway down here?
Uh, six thirty-five?
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
And there are, um, all along that, that freeway there are restaurant
but one of our favorites is Pappasito's.
Oh, yeah,
Pappasito's.
No,
we love to go there.
We went there on my birthday  in March it's great.
You know it always kills me cause I don't like the, the decorations so much
it's too,
too much like a bar naturally,  and Mexico,
Yeah
yeah,
I know,
I've seen it.
But I love the food I love the food,
The food is probably,
the food is great.
I'm not a I'm Mexican food gourmet by any means
but it's probably the best tasting,
I don't know would you classify that as Tex-Mex?
Yeah,
uh-huh.
Um, the shredded beef the type of,  spices  or sauces they use.
Yeah.
Uh-huh,
I like to get that, uh,
a shrimp it's a shrimp dish,
Really.
and  I don't remember the name of it,
Uh-huh.
but  it's rolled up into, into something,
and oh, it's really good.
I've never had anything there that wasn't delicious.
Yeah,
they are really good.
Even though you have to stand in line and all of that, that's the only thing I don't like about it too
it's a little bit with the meat market atmosphere, you know.
Yeah,
yeah.
Even though we don't have kids we've been married long enough to, um, be around not be around that.
Yeah.
Um, I'm trying to think of what else we like to eat.
The one thing I notice is it's just, um, about dining out that you probably can relate to with four children and two of us getting ready to adopt, I mean we find prohibited,  just to  cost any more?
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
I mean lunch today was eighteen dollars.
Yeah,
it's very expensive.
Yeah,
I don't know how you feel about that
but I think that some of it's over priced.
Yeah
I'm glad I'm talking about food normally these conversations are
Sometimes it's hard isn't it to keep a,
Yeah,
it is I don't know, um,
No,
sometimes Mark and I, that's my husband Mark,  um,  go to the August Moon which is down there
Uh-huh.
it's a Chinese,  uh, restaurant with the lions in  the front,
Oh, yeah,
my husband likes that.
yeah,
off of Arapaho down there?
yeah,
and, Oh, it's pretty good as far as Chinese,
Yeah,
August Moon,
uh-huh.
but Chinese isn't my favorite
so,
I don't like it at all usually
so
But he likes it kind of
so he heats us up a good fight
now, me I'm like I said seafood I'm,
I like that.
Yeah,
I love seafood,
So.
and  I, I like a lot of different ethnic foods.
I like Japanese food.
There's a place on Greenville called Sagar's .
Um.
Well, we haven't been in years down near Presby ,
and I had a meeting down there today
and I saw that
and I said, gee I remember that they offer you, um, authentic Japanese feeding,  or  American or piano bar,
Oh.
and I remember when we went  we  were married with another couple that was just dating
and, um, I had never had saki.
Uh-huh.
It made all raw fish tastes great
but if you're looking for a very, uh,
it's very pretty inside,
Is it?
and the  girls wear kimonos and, You know, if you're ever looking for that.
Oh, how nice.
Yeah.
Um, but what other kind of foods,
gee I don't know
we went to a place called Grishman's in Greenville,  which was really over priced.
I don't know that place.
Was it?
Uh-huh.
They had a great desert bar.
Um.
That's what we need isn't it?
Yeah.
No,
there's a lot of nice barbecue places here,
now, I like barbecue okay, Texas barbecue.
Yeah,
I like,  barbecue,
It's good.
have  you ever been to I think it's called Spring Creek Barbecue?
Yeah,
now,  they're real good.
That's real good,
Yeah.
They are good.
There had,
oh my husband's going upstairs,
and he says free ice cream
Yeah,
free ice cream,
yeah.
I didn't know they had that.
Yeah.
I can't talk I had chocolate bavarian tort, for desert,  today,  which I never eat at lunch
Oh.
and it was wonderful.
Just to die for exactly.
It was,
Oh.
in  fact if I could pick my, um, restaurants on how their coffee is and how their french bread is and the butter and the desert I would be,  yes, I  would be in hog heaven.
In heaven
And how are your kids at an age where they can contribute to what they want
or do you still order for them?
Well, my two littlest,
I just had a baby,
Oh, congratulations.
and she's  six months
and then my four year old he, he still,
but my other older two they can.
So,  they're  they're kind of,
Uh-huh.
my littlest girl she's still like wants McDonald's, McDonald's, McDonald's
Yeah,
everybody, every child that I even know that eats vegetables, um, looked five years old still after a certain age realized that there is something called a McDonald's.
Oh, I'm telling you.
It's really sad isn't it cause it's hard to get them away from junk then.
Well, it's kind of funny is sometimes we're like we all want different things,
Uh-huh.
and  so there's a H Avenue down here,  and along are these fast  food restaurants
Uh-huh,
I know where that,
Right
that's all,
So we all get to go to our own little thing and drive through and get our own thing,
and  then we go to park over there so we can all have our own.
Well, that's all right as long as,
that's on the nights we can't decide.
I was going to say because with six people how do you, um,
cause with two we have a problem,
I mean I can't even imagine, you know, trying to, um,
you sound like you're doing pretty well with four children.
Well, five of them, they're good, kids.
That's the way the,
Yeah,
well, we're getting ready to
I shouldn't say this on this conversation,
but it's just on my mind,
we're getting ready to go overseas to adopt.
Oh, how nice.
Yeah,
we're excited,
It will be neat.
I think it will be worth it
and somebody said to me in terms of,
this is food so I can say this,
but they, you have to bring a formula,
and I said what's that
They laughed
and I said well, you know, I'm.  thirty something,
Food's, food.
Yeah.
and  I think that that would make them drool any way.
Yeah,
yeah.
You, know, I guess are you is it a little bit of constricted, because a lot of restaurants don't take,
in terms of talking about restaurants, I mean are a lot of restaurants, how are they when you have children let alone three or four children?
You have to be careful if you go to a, a restaurant that,  that  really is more adults you know,  with  the atmosphere and everything,
Uh-huh.
Sure.
they,
if you're,
like we could probably take our oldest son and,  and  our oldest daughter.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
And they know how to act,
Yeah.
I  don't think I would chance it with my younger ones because they're just too much of a distraction
and some restaurants are really trying to go for that atmosphere kind of thing.
That yuppie kind of crowd, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So.
I just, I just, I've been in some places where they say they take children,
and then I've just seen where the wait attendance the wait staff is rude, you know.
Yeah.
And that always just bothered me
and then, um, on the other hand sometimes the children or the adults are themselves
Yeah
I don't know what other kind of restaurants
really Pappasito's we love, um,
we went to one Italian,
back on the Italian, we went to some place across from Collin Creek Mall that absolutely putrid for Italian food.
Oh.
I can't remember the name of it
it's on, uh,
Is it Tia's, not Tia's, um,
No,
that's Mexican, um, right across from on the Dillard's side there,
Yeah,
I know which one it is,
and I can't think of it.
I can't,
yeah
it's in the strip, yeah,
and it had white tablecloth,
I think it was like paper where you could write on them, or something with crayons
it was just terrible.
Oh dear.
I mean I was shocked,
I mean the dish was dirty, um,
It was one of these you have bad experience and,  say I don't think I'll  come back here.
Yeah,
where you felt like,  like when you're in a bad part of Italy or something.
Oh dear.
Um.
Oh.
Boy,
but other then that I don't know we, we do our share of pizza eating too, but more like go get it and carry it in cause we're too,  cheap  to pay the delivery
Oh.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I don't like strange people coming to my door, um,
Well, I, I've got
one of my favorites were
and I can't really think of any other, um, places.
No,
except that this makes me fat.
No,
I'm just kidding.
Yeah,
you have to watch it if you go out to eat
that's true.
Yeah,
that's true,
but you can always blame it on having children,
no
Yeah,
there you go.
Well, I enjoyed talking to you,
and I guess, you know, Maybe we'll see you in the restaurants somewhere.
Well, good luck.
Yeah,
maybe.
Okay.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.

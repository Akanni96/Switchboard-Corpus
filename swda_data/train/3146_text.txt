Okay.
Hi,  Nancy.

Well, do you do a lot of dining out?
No, um,
we don't although we enjoy it.
Um, we do it more when we have company  come.
Uh-huh.
Um, what about you?
Well, we do some dining out.
Um, I, I do a lot of cooking
so, um, mostly like when we go out, you know, it's my husband and I,
I, we don't go out too often as a family, um, unless it's like a fast-food kind of thing.
But, um, but we do enjoy dining out.
One of our favorite places here in, in the Dallas area is Atlantic Cafe.
I don't know if you, have you ever been there?
I've heard of that
but I haven't been there.
Um, where, about is that?
Um, well actually there's the Atlantic Cafe and Cafe Pacific,  and, uh,
Oh, okay.
I, I've been to Cafe Pacific.
Have you?
now that's down in, uh, Highland Park.
Right.
It's Highland Park Village.
Did you like it?
Yes.
Uh
Oh, I love it
Before we moved to, the area, my brother, uh, lived in Dallas for a number of years
and we came up one time when my father was visiting
and we all ate there
Uh-huh.
and, oh, their seafood was wonderful.
Oh, it is, it's fabulous.
It really is a great place.
Now where is  the Atlantic Cafe?
Atlantic Cafe is down on, I believe it's on McKinney.
Oh, okay.
Um, and originally the two, the, the guy who owns the Cafe Pacific and the guy who owns the Atlantic Cafe, were partners in the Atlantic Cafe.
And then they, they separated
and the guy started Cafe Pacific.
And, I loved them both.
I really do.
I think they're wonderful.
That's our favorite.
You know what we'd really like, if, if we just have a, a casual evening is Houston's.
Have you been there?
No, um,
but I've heard that's really good, too,
and,
It's wonderful.
The only thing is you have to wait.
You have, you have to expect to wait at least an hour.
Oh.
So you have to go knowing you're going to be sitting there there for an hour waiting to get in.
And, as long as you know that it's okay.
But they have, I think, one, just about the best prime rib um, anywhere in the area.
Oh.
Oh, okay.
I love it.
Uh-huh.
And, my husband really likes their ribs.
So it's hysterical.
We go in
and we sit there for an hour waiting to get in
and then we get there
and we don't even look at the menu   .
You know right away  what you want
I know  right away what we, what we want.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, we really enjoy prime rib, too,
and, uh, actually the, the Steak And Ale out here, uh, we've gone to, uh,
my in-laws also enjoy prime rib, when  they've  had some of their specials on Sunday, Monday, or Tuesday  night
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
and, uh, the time we went the prime rib was really good.
Was it?
Really?
I've I've, I've been there for like, you know, lunch
Uh-huh.
but, I've never been there for dinner.
And, it was good,
yeah.
Yeah,
yeah
Oh, that's great.
That's, great.
Another nice place for, for prime rib is Baby Doe's
Oh, I've heard about that, too
Maxwell's nice,
have you been there?
but no.
We've, uh, I guess we eat out even less than I realize
And I didn't think we ate out very often
See!
Baby Doe's is nice.
Oh
And, one place I'd never been that I would really like to go to, uh, is Lawry's.
I've heard that's real good,  Lawry's  Prime Rib?
Yeah.
Yes,
I'd, I had heard that, too. Um,
I've, I've never been there
but I've heard it's real good.
Have you been to the little, uh, not for prime rib but the Cafe De France, um, right  here  on Central Expressway? *slash error Oh, okay. *slash error should be bk
Yes.
Yes,
actually they have one in Richardson that I've been to.
Uh, they have real nice lunches.
Have you, have you been there for lunch?
Or,
Yes, uh
Yeah.
primarily lunch, well, and breakfast sometimes
but, uh, during the week they often have, a, a limited menu choice but, uh, very reasonable complete dinners for six ninety-nine that  included  the soup or salad entrees and accompaniments and dessert
Really?
Really?
and, uh, the,
my husband and I like veal,  uh  a lot
Uh-huh.
and their veal dishes have been good.
We've tried different ones when they've had them as one of the
The specials.
Uh-huh.
Have you ever been to Biffin's?

I  keep hearing about it.
I keep hearing the advertisements of it
I,
yes,
no,
and, and they  keep saying, you know, oh, it's wonderful, it's wonderful.
I have not been over there
and I was thinking, you know, it's supposed to be a family place over near Plano Super Bowl.
Right.
And,
And, uh, I've, I've not been there.
I haven't either, uh,
one place,
and I've only been there for lunch,
but, uh, I went with a friend,
and we met her husband, um, down on Greenville,
down near the Highway Twelve area, is Gershwin's,
I've been there.
Oh, I, we just
That was nice
It was
and we had the, uh, we both enjoy mushroom soup
and Linda had told me they had the best mushroom soup
and they did.
It was wonderful
but, uh, and we just had soup and salad so we could make room for the dessert   which was a chocolate sack.
I don't know if you tried
but  or
Oh
I've heard of it.
Where, where it's made,
it's like, it's like a,
it's all chocolate, like made like a paper bag
Yes!  and whip cream
and  it's filled with what, whip cream  and, and strawberries and something?
Yeah.
and it had strawberries, kiwis, and raspberries in a raspberry, uh, puree
Oh.
and, and we shared one, the three of us
Oh.
and it was plenty because it was very rich
but, uh I wished I'd had a camera.
Oh.
It was beautiful
Oh, I bet it was.
I bet it was.
Uh
The last time we went to Cafe Pacific, it was Father's Day,
and we took another friend with us
Oh.
and, uh, for dessert we thought we had just stuffed ourselves
And so we had, they had, uh, like a berry assortment.
It was, it was raspberries and blueberries and, and strawberries on a plate with like a custard on the bottom.
Oh.
And, you know, they did, like the raspberry puree, just kind of like in a, in a decoration on the,
you know, how they do the plates real fancy with the decorations and then piled the berries and shaved chocolate on top of it
Yes.
Yeah
Oh.
and it was  outstanding.
It sounds  wonderful.
It was really, really relatively simple
but, oh, it was good.
It was really good.
Well, that's, uh, one of the things that I do enjoy when you get a good restaurant.
Uh, I love fresh berries.
And, their, their fruits are always exceptional.
I don't, I'm, know
they must have a special source for getting them because even at the Farmer's Market, uh,  you can't  find them like that
You can't  find them.
Yeah.
and,
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
You know, I'm originally from Connecticut
and, uh, I was home a few years ago
and my sister and brother-in-law were going to take us out for dinner
and, uh, I was really amazed, you know,
the, the restaurants up there were kind of quaint.
You know, they were real, real pretty
but they lacked, the service
and they lacked the the, just the, I don't know.
The restaurants down here seem like they have, uh,
I guess there's so much competition that they, really have to be good.
Uh-huh.
And, I thought I would really miss that.
I would, too,
because, well, because we don't go out very often.
When we do go out, um, in a way it's like a little mini vacation I guess,
and, uh, it is, it's a whole experience.
Of course you want the food to be good
but the atmosphere and service I think, are important, uh too.
Uh-huh.
And, you know, in order to survive in this area I think they have to be good.
Yeah.
Because  the ones that aren't so good don't, just don't make it.
Um, that reminded me of a place for lunch that's a little off the beaten track
but it is wonderful.
It's called Cafe Max
and it's at Plano Road and Campbell.
They have the most wonderful salads.
They do what they call a salad sampler which easily could feed  two or three.
Oh, really?

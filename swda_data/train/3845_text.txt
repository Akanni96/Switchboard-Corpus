Well what do you think about the everyday occurrences that are, that are an invasion of your privacy?
Well, the, uh,
what I really, I don't like is the the constant calls, people selling things people telling me I want things. You know, people trying to solicit for different, you know, organizations.
Oh.
Right.
You know, that's what I really.
Yeah,
I think that's, that's the only thing I wrote down also,
because that's just a, it's terrible today,
I mean, my wife and I, seems like we get home at five thirty and the damn phone starts ringing and rings up until ten, eleven o'clock sometimes.
Never stops ringing,
right.
That's right.
Well, you know, the, the great, uh, thing for that, it's, uh, is, is an answering machine
Yes,
I know,
that's true.
I mean, this is, this is the, one of the best inventions ever, you know,
you just switch that thing on,
and, uh,
Yeah,
that's true.
Yeah.
But, you know, people,
it's like your name must be on a list or something, because I know at my office, I get calls, I mean, I must get at least, I probably average at least a call a day,
and a lot of days I'll get two and three calls, from from people selling insurance you know, to the small business man
Um, even in an office?
Uh-huh.
Right.
and, uh, you know, I think Dunn and Bradstreet puts your, according to what I understand, Dunn and Bradstreet puts your names, your name out to people also,
as far as brokers all, I get calls from brokers in New York,
and, uh California, always trying to sell something, oil, oil investments or  stock investments  or whatever.
Uh-huh.
Right,
right.
And now I'm getting the same calls at at the house.
Uh-huh,
I know.
And they get your,  and they get your name from Dunn and Bradstreet,
and, uh, credit card companies, they sell your name.
Oh, yeah,
uh, well, you know, these people, they sell your names,
I mean
I know.  Yes.
you know, I,
that's also an invasion of privacy.
I think it the whole thing is, uh,
American Express does that, by the way.
Oh, they do?
Yeah,
I understand they sell it, you know, they sell names because it's quite profitable to them.
Well, sure it is.
And that is an invasion of privacy,
you're right.
That's right.
Well, you know, if you've ever gotten anything, you know, in your life, your, your name is somewhere
I know,
that's true.
I mean, one magazine, and boom, they got your name forever.
Exactly,
magazine companies, uh, uh, from, from subscriptions do the same thing
Uh-huh.
it's the way they make additional money.
That's right.
But, it's, uh, you know, I guess, it, uh,
you have to be a certain income holder to, uh, have an American Express card,
so your name is valuable to, I guess, X amount of solicitors calling.
Yeah,
that's right.
So, I don't know.
What, what do you, where are you from?
Oh, I'm from Texas.
Oh, okay,
well so,
yeah,
we live in the Dallas area,  Richardson.
Oh,  we're in Plano.
Okay
Well, you know, the only call I really got that, well, was out of state,
I got one from Oklahoma City, and one from California.
Did you?
And that was, uh, California,
I was thrilled to death, because that's, you know, the furthest I'd gotten any call from, you know,
and, um,
Yeah,
I got, I've talked to people in Utah, people in New York
Oh, really.
and a lot of times I'll call eight or nine o'clock in the morning
and I'll get people you know, from out of the, uh, out of the state.
Oh.
Yeah,
see, well that's, uh, the, there was another call on Saturday, Saturday that was also from, uh, that was the one from California.
I don't know why I ask people on the weekends from out of state,
or, uh, I don't know,  you know,
but,
I'll be darned.
Where you from?
Not from Texas.
Uh, originally  from New Jersey.
New Jersey,
right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
My wife's from New Jersey.
Oh, really,
what part?
Yeah,
from, uh, Saddle River.
Oh, that's nice over there.
She,
Yeah,
we're from more, uh, from sort of towards the shore,  central  New Jersey, you know,
Okay.
we're like, uh,
Well, that's nice, too.
Yeah,
oh yeah,
it was beautiful,
that's why I, I really miss it.
I, I don't really like it here at all
Really,
yes,
my wife's been away for twenty-five years,
so she's been away for quite a while.
Uh-huh.
Her dad was from Little Rock, Arkansas,
and her mother was from New York,
so they just they over there in New Jersey.
Yeah,
so they,
Yeah
Uh, and anyway, this topic is, is a good topic, as far as invasion of your privacy,
but that's the, the biggest one I can think of is just, just  all the solicitors calling.
Well, yeah,
I mean,
yeah,
yeah,
and, then, of course they call, you know,
before I got the answering machine, it was ridiculous
I know.
you know, I said, this is absurd,
I, you know, I, the minute I get home the phone would be ringing.
That's a, that's a good suggestion.
I might start using the answering machine more, because it's so hard to not pick up that phone when it rings.
Oh, it's great,
I mean.
Well, you know, in fact, I've been missing calls from the T I switchboard,
because I, I always have it on you know,
Right.
and I'll get that, that message that says, uh, to, uh, um, you know, uh, end this call, press three
Sure.
and I assumed I, you know, it was from the switchboard.
You know
Yeah,
you're probably right.
Yeah
it is, because one day I listened, you know, and it was you know,
but, um, I, I just got totally disgusted,
and then, you know, people asking for, for money for everything,  you know,
I mean.  Exactly,
I understand.
I mean, I,
it's hard to believe there's that many deputy sheriffs associations
and,
and, you know, the policeman's associations.
I know,
they call you one time to send three kids to the carnival or circus
Oh, I used to do that.
and,
Yeah,
I used to do that,
I'd send, or three kids to the movies or something
Right.
There's always a
and I, my, my pat answer now is, well, you just called me the other night,

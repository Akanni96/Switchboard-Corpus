Well, I'll tell you why I feel so,
I feel strongly about this topic.
I don't know a whole lot about the immigration laws.
But I do know that in the, where I live and I teach school, there are so many Orientals that have come here
and there's a lot of Mexican people too. Which is not, neither here nor there,
but the fact is that all the Orientals that are here are very affluent, uh, very wise in money matters and have have taken over a lot of businesses,
and have,
Really,
it's kind of scary because they're so bright.
They're, all the kids that I have that are Oriental are really far above the American kids.
And they,
and the, the parents are unbelievable because they are just on the way up.
And money is their main goal.
And it's it really is kind of scary because there's, there's just oodles of them.
And you can not believe the businesses and corporations that have been taken over by Orientals.
And it's it's kind of scares me, not that I don't want them here and not that I don't appreciate the fact that, you know, that they have rights too.
But on the other hand, you feel like almost they're, they're invading us to the point where they're going to take over
Right.
Actually my son once said that, that, perhaps, uh, what we should do is, is buy a little square of land some place in the Midwest.
And, and that might be the solution
I think probably that's,
Uh-huh.
And I was born in Ohio,
Uh-huh.
so  it, it really
and there is, there are a lot of Mexican people here because we're so close to the border.
Uh-huh.
And, and they are wonderful people
and, and I'm not, you know, I don't want to deny them their rights.
Just that you, you feel like when you were born and raised here and you worked very hard to make this country what it is, uh, it scares you when you feel like somebody's taking over.
And a lot of these people plan one day to go back, you know, to, to Vietnam or to, you know, Taiwan or wherever they're from. And take with them a lot of American dollars plus a lot of power in American companies.
And it's kind of scary
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
And, you know,  I don't know,
I don't know the immigration laws that, uh, that
well and I do not,
and in fact I don't know them at all.
I don't know how many people they allow in the United States per year or if there's even a,
I don't even know if there is a number that they allow in anymore.
Do you know anything about  that?
No,
I don't,
I don't know.
I lived in the Middle East for sometime
and I, I  do  believe there must have been some sort of quota system because, uh, I know a lot of people that were, in a sense, not, qualified is the wrong word, but certainly were deserving to come.
Oh.
Uh-huh.
And  it seemed to take them a long time
or, or there was a lot of uncertainty as to whether they would be able to come
Yeah.
And so I would guess that, you know, there are quotas for different places.
I would think so too.
It,
You know, I, I, I think there's something about being able to, to claim, um, imminent danger
or, I'm not sure what the terminology is.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
Maybe political
Asylum, of some sort.
Yeah.
There, there you go.
You got the term.
Uh-huh.
And maybe that's a, an issue with a, a lot of people.
I don't know.
I, I guess I haven't been in a situation where it's, it's been threatening to, to me. Uh,
and, and, uh, my kids go to school in another suburb of Dallas. And, with very, very good school systems.
And they're considered, you know one of the top three in the state. Both of them, you know.
Uh-huh.
And it seems like a lot of the Orientals make sure that their kids go to these schools.
Uh-huh.
And they're head and shoulders above a lot of the kids here.
And the kids in this area are very bright. And come from, you know, parents that are professionals or semiprofessionals and, and, uh, very interested in their education.
But, uh, I think in the, last year, I'm not, if I'm not mistaken, in four of the six high schools, the graduating class valedictorian and salutatorian were, uh, half or more Oriental.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
And, you know, they're just extremely bright kids.
And also they value learning.
I was going to say, I'm not I, I would guess that it's not that they are any brighter,
but they just maybe work harder
or,
Well, I, I think things come easy for them too.
But I do think that they have that work ethic that we somehow have missed the boat in with a lot of kids in the United States.
I don't, they, uh, don't want to work for anything.
They want it to come to them but and be there
but they don't want to work hard.
And these kids work really hard.
Right,
right.

And,  and they have,
but maybe part of that's the problem that here we've, we've let this value slip.
Yeah.
I know,
I agree with that.
And they need to have some competition.
But what I see is
the competition is there,
but instead of meeting the challenge, they're starting to resent them.
Uh-huh.
And it's causing, you know, I think some, some problems.
Well, that's too bad.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
And it's mainly Black and, and, and Hispanic.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
But, uh, there is some, there has been some resentment with Orientals in the Black community because they've started businesses there,
and the Blacks resent them coming in and taking their money,
and there's been some violence because of it.
Oh, that's really sad.
It is.
It's, it is very sad.
Uh-huh.
So, you know, I really,
I, I've, I've always prided myself on not being prejudiced and being, you know, uh, welcome, welcoming everyone that wants to come here.
Uh-huh.
And even when I was younger when I was in college, I was a member of the N A A C P because I lived up north,
and I was very into that, the human rights part of everything.
Uh-huh.
But I, I've, I've become very cynical in the last three, four years living in Texas.
Uh-huh.
Well, and it sounds like you feel that there is need for change.
Maybe the, uh, you know, the
there is too big of a concentration coming all at once to, to allow for adequate melting into the society.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
Well, and exactly,
that's exactly true.
Plus the fact that these people do come for a short period of time. Two, two, three, four maybe five years and then go back. And pick our brains, which is wonderful, and take all that back with them.
And, and, uh, plus a lot of American dollars.
But in, in the long run maybe that's going to make a better world too.
Right.
You know,  you just don't know.
Exactly.
and yet, you know, with, uh, with, uh,
there's somebody on my other line
but I'm going to ignore  that.
Oh.
Uh, anyway I just,
you, you kind of, you you really don't know what to do.
And, and I don't,
I want my kids to have values where they're accepting and so forth.
Uh-huh.
And both of my children are really more tolerant of Blacks and Hispanics than they are of the Orientals,  for  some reason.
Um.
They feel, you know, like they've taken over.
They feel like, uh, you know, they're taking some of the, the rewards that they should have.
Right.
And I really don't want that to happen.
Right,
But,  but it's happening.
right.
Right.
And I think a lot of their friends feel the same way too.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
So, and I really do wish I knew about quotas and really wish I
Right.
I would, I would suspect that they have.
Well, I guess, um, I don't have much, much more to contribute to the topic.
Yeah.
I don't really either.
I wish I knew more.
Yeah.
Probably if I did, I might be a little bit more, uh, tolerant,  perhaps.
Uh-huh.
And I,
and even if I, I really wish I knew the situations they were going back to or coming from.
Uh-huh.
You don't know any of that
and you feel, you know, you can't put yourself in their shoes or really understand them.
Right.
Unless,
and for some reason Orientals are very, uh,
my good friend calls them pushy,
but I call them very, that
they know what they want
and they go get it.
Uh-huh.
And in stores and so  and so forth  it's,
Goal directed.
pardon me?
Goal directed.
Yeah.
But in stores and things, sometimes they can be very impolite because they can, they get in front of you or they, uh, they take something that you had in mind to get before you did.
Oh.
I see.
You know, just going for it, they take it quickly.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, they don't think anything of that.
And I don't, you know,
that's makes people resentful too.
And so, And yet they have, they have a right to be here
Sure,
sure.
and I know that.
Uh-huh.
But it's, it sometimes it's gets touchy.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
So, and I'm sure it's a lot different,
you're from Maryland,  You said?
Yes,
What part of Maryland are you from?
Up in the Gaithersburg area.
Oh, okay.
My sister used to live  there,  in that area.
Uh-huh.
And I, I'm sure that it's a lot different there.
Uh, it's a lot different in than, in Iowa than  it is here.
Well, no.
Is that right?
And with the same, you know, some of the, some of the same problems that you've mentioned.
But, uh, I don't know,
I guess I wasn't involved enough to, to, uh, really stop to think about it.
Uh-huh.
Well, I, you know, since I teach, I see see it.
And, and I feel
and I love the example that most of these children give the, our American children.
And yet, you know, I can see why some of the parents are that are  fearful too.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
And, and it's a kind of a touchy situation.
Uh-huh.
And I wish that we could all just learn from each other and not feel threatened.
But it doesn't happen that way all the time.
Exactly,
exactly.
Right,
right.
So anyway,
Well, it was good talking to you.
It was good to talk to,  to you too.
And I
And have a good trip in California.
Okay.
And have a good weekend.
All right.
Well thank you.
all righty,
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye

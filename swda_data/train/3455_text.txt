Okay,
uh, I guess our topic is about movies
Uh-huh.
and, uh, what is coincidence,
we got a baby-sitter
and we went to the movies that past weekend.
Oh, so did I
And we saw CAPE FEAR.
Oh, I heard that was excellent.
It is.
Is it?
It's really good.
Uh, I wanted to see that
I was deciding between that and, uh, MY GIRL
and, uh, my boyfriend and I went to see MY GIRL.
Oh, how was that?
Oh, it was excellent.
It was a really, really good movie.
I'd recommend it.
I heard that's, a movie that, uh, you really can't take children.
Is that true?
Uh, I heard the opposite that, uh, you should take children to see it.
Oh.
Uh, there were quite a few, uh, kids in there with their parents.
Oh.
Yeah.
Uh, I don't know, though,
I, I've heard that, and then what you just told me
so,
Yeah,
yeah,
because, uh, the little boy dies.
Right,
yeah.
Yeah.
It was sad.
It was really sad.
Oh.
But, uh, his, it kind of shows how his, uh, best friend, this little girl, deals with his death and how, I think, maybe, how children should deal with death.
Oh.
Oh.
Maybe.
Uh-huh.
But, it was really good.
It was sad, very sad.
Oh, I want to see that one.
Well, CAPE FEAR was, was more suspenseful.
Yeah.
It was really suspenseful.
So that, that's, that's a real good movie to see.
I heard it was, uh, sort of like, uh, not, uh, too violent,
but it was kind of like, uh, gross, kind of like, uh, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, like.
Uh, no,
and it, uh, it was kind of,
I don't know,
it's kind of both, I guess,
but it's not, it's not as bad as SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.
Oh, really?
But, uh, it's just as suspenseful, I think.
Oh.
And it, it was a real good movie.
And then we saw BEAUTY AND THE BEAST Because we have two kids. And FIEVEL GOES WEST
Oh, yeah.
Uh.
Oh, I've seen, uh, previews for them on T V,
but I,
But, uh, those were, those were okay,
so, And then, oh, boy, it's been, it's been so long since we've been to the movies,
Yeah.
but I, we've rented some videos.
Oh, yeah,
I like to rent movies, too.
And I think the last one I rented was, uh, MORTAL THOUGHTS with Demi Moore.
Oh.
Oh, I, I didn't see that.
And, uh, that, that, that's okay.
That's pretty good.
Yeah.
Oh, and, uh, WHAT ABOUT BOB?
I have seen that at the theatres,
Yeah.
yeah.
Yeah,
we rented that one.
That, that was cute.
And, uh, uh, I guess that's about it.
Have you rented any movies lately?
Uh, the last movie I rented was THE HARD WAY with Michael J. Fox
and, uh,
Oh, yeah,
that was good.
We rented that one, too.
Yeah,
I liked that.
I like Michael J. Fox a lot.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
He's one of my favorites.
Yeah.
I like his movies.
So, do you go to the movies often,
or,
No,
not too often.
I, I hadn't been to the movies for a really long time since last weekend.
Uh-huh.
But, uh, there's been movies out that I've been wanting to see.
I just, you know, don't get a chance to get out and see them.
Yeah,
yeah,
well, we have two little kids,
so it's hard for us to get out and go to the movies.
We have to dig up a baby-sitter
and And that's only the only time we can go out,
Oh I see.
so our time is scarce.
Yeah.
Oh.
But, uh, we, we, we we, you know, we're, we're big movie people
and we try and do
Yeah.
and I don't, I don't know about the last movie I've seen on T V that was real good. Uh,
Oh, I watched that movie with, uh, Barbara, uh, uh,
what was her name.
Oh,
that, uh, her sister got killed
and, uh, she had a baby.
The husband was a dentist
and he had murdered her.
Oh, yeah,
uh, Bertinelli, or what's her name.
That was, that was pretty good.
Yeah,
uh-huh,
oh, Valerie Bertinelli.
I can't,
That's it,
yeah.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah
Yeah,
that was real good,
I saw that one, uh, two part series,
and I heard it was a true story.
Yeah,
uh-huh.
Yeah,
I think that was probably the last movie I've seen, too.
Yeah.
And, and then I saw that other movie about, uh, MOTHER, MOTHER, WIFE, MURDERER.
Did you see that one?
Oh, uh, with, uh, Judith Light?
Yeah.
Uh,
Did you see that one,
that was, was really good.
That was supposed to be a true story, too.
Yeah,
I did see that.
Yeah,
I did.
That was on a while ago, wasn't it?
Yeah.
Yeah,
I saw that.
Guess a couple weeks ago or something like that.
Yeah,
that was pretty good.
Boy we have we, we see all the same movies.
I,
Yeah.
I like, uh, the true stories.
Yeah.
They're more interesting.
Uh-huh.
And it's hard to believe that, you know, this really happened.
I know.
Some of them are pretty bad.
Yeah,
yeah.
But,
Huh. Well We sure do have a lot in common.
Yeah.
If you're ever in town, we'll go see a movie
Okay
But, and we don't really,
do you all have, do you all still have drive-ins up there
or,
Yeah,
uh-huh.
Yeah,
do you have them there?
Um, well, we may have just a couple over here.

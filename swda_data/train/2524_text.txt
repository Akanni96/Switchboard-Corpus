Okay.
Hi,
I, uh, I like, I love to do, uh, all kinds of crafts and sewing,
I, I find that's my one release
Uh-huh.
Um, I like to do like physical things like sports.
Uh-huh.
Um, I really enjoy softball
and my favorite is volleyball,
Uh-huh.
and, but, I'm at school,
I'm in, you know,
I I live up at the college, So sometimes it's hard for me to do that,
Uh-huh.
so I just, like sometimes,
I like, just to get away,
I go to my room and I like walk in, turn the radio on, or, you know, just kind of like veg out or something.
Uh-huh.
Well I have two small kids
and so, I, I don't have, you know, much time to, to go places and play sports, you know,
Uh-huh.
I have to do something where I can do it at home.
So, I'm, uh, I just love to sew
and, uh, you know, I I make a lot of my Christmas presents,
Uh-huh.
and I love to do all kinds of crafts and stuff like that.
I like to do that stuff, but when I'm in, like when I'm at school, I don't have time to do it or even time to learn how to do it.
No,
I remember when I was in college,
I didn't have time to do that stuff either.
It was really,
Yeah.
But now, you know, I don't have a whole lot of time now but I have more time than I did,
so.
Uh-huh.
And a lot of my sewing I kind of do out of necessity, you know,
for,
you know, I've got two kids to put clothes on,
so.
Yeah,
exactly,
uh-huh.
Like, um, I have, I come from a family of twelve children,
Oh.
and when I'm up here, I really miss my younger brothers and sisters,
so you know, that's, that's a change, because there's nine of them that are younger than me.
Uh-huh.
I'll call like when I know my mom and dad aren't home, I'll call home just to talk to my little brothers and sisters.
I, I really miss them a lot
so I don't,
I guess talking on the phone is one of my hobbies too.
Yeah,
I,
yeah,
I just, uh, have, you know, one brother and he's married,
and, you know, they have a couple kids,
so I, you know, I don't have, uh, you know, I don't get on the phone too much.
But, yeah
most of my stuff is just going
you know I enjoy going places with my kids
and I do like sports, but I'm, you know, I don't have a lot of time for them.
My,
I like volleyball.
Of all sports, I think that would be my favorite, because I hate basketball
Yeah,
well, I'm not much of a basketball fan either.
I enjoy playing volleyball but I, you know, I, I don't have a lot of time to do it,
so.
Uh-huh,
yeah.
It's maybe once a year or something
an,
and then I, you know, used to play it a lot when I was in school,
but now that I'm married and stuff I, you know I've like, I'm really bad.
Nobody would want me on their team.
I'm the, you know, I'm the opposing teams best player, so, so to speak,
so.
Uh-huh.
But, yeah,
I enjoy, um, you know, just,
I, you know, I have varied interests and stuff
and yeah,
so.
Yeah,
um, not that I like reading, but I do do a lot of reading while I'm here at school.
Uh-huh.
Do you like reading as a hobby?
Uh, I love to read, but I, you know, I don't have a lot of time to read an, You know, what reading I do, I kind of do because it's, you know, it's the necessary stuff
Yeah.
as far as fun reading, you know, I maybe get to read the Sunday paper, but, that's about it, you know,
so.
Yeah.
Yeah,
I don't have a lot of time to read.
I, yeah, I remember in college, I did a lot of reading, most of it text books,
so.
Uh-huh.
And, just,
you know keeping busy with everything else going on,
so. But yeah,
I, I like to do, uh,
I've made stuffed cows, you know, dress, you know, dolls,
they're like dolls,
Uh-huh.
you know, you make clothes for them and everything like that.
Yeah.
They, those have been real popular with my family.
I've had them calling up and saying, will you make me another one
and, so, I do things like that, you know,
if I had more time, I'd probably do it and sell the stuff
but, you know, I don't have enough time to do it to really, you know, take orders on it,
Uh-huh,
yeah.
you know, it's like I can only do it when I have time.
I have a whole stack of material and patterns to sew up as it is,
so.
Do you, um,
I know one thing that's pretty popular with the girls up here at college, and I make them also, is the padded covered photo albums?
Oh yeah,
uh-huh,
I do,
I've done those too, before,
yeah.
Uh-huh.
Those are real,
I, I have a several of those that I've made like as wedding gifts, you know.
I made them out of all lace and, and satin, you know, and made them as wedding gifts and stuff like that,
so.
Yeah.
Those are real popular,
in fact, I got some of those for my wedding,
so.
Uh-huh.
I know they're real popular here at school, also.
Uh-huh,
yeah,
yeah,
those are fun to do,
and just little things, you know,
I, I didn't have a lot of,
when I was in college I did, you know, I did sewing for other people when I had time, you know,
like if somebody needed a bridesmaids, maids dress made, I'd make that,
but that's about all the sewing I did,
I never had time for, you know, to sew myself a new dress or anything like that
so, but, yeah.
Uh-huh.
I just kind of sew for my kids
and that's about it,
so.
Well, I guess maybe we've covered the topic, pretty good.
Yeah.
I really don't have any other.
Yeah,
I'm not too much, uh, you know,
I don't have a lot of hobbies,
mine are just mostly, you know things I just do out of necessity.
Uh-huh.
Okay,

It was nice talking to you too.
Good luck in school.

I say Arlington, Texas now because I talked one night to somebody in Arlington, Virginia.
Oh, my,
yeah.
Well, and Plano, Texas rather than Plano, Illinois.
Oh, do they have one?
Yes,
they do.
Oh, I didn't know that.
Well, I learned something already
Yeah.
Well, let's see,
the three questions are what, uh,
How much time do you spend with your children?
Very little. Because they're grown.
Oh
What?
They're grown and gone.
Oh, yeah,
well, mine is, uh, down at U T Austin at college
and the other one is in high school.
Huh.
So you do spend less time then?
Yeah
because they don't want to know, they almost don't want to know us.
They want to be with their friends.
How old are your kids?
Are they married or what?
Uh, yes,
I have, uh, two married, two and then two almost married
and the other two, I'm not sure.
Well, Two two, two, uh, uh, for sure are single.
Oh, boy, you have a lot of kids.
Yeah,
we have, between the spouse and myself we have six.
Oh, well, that's kind of nice, though.
You you shouldn't be lonesome on a holiday, huh?
Because I came with a split family
and she had,
Well, no,
there is so much of them are gone
and they're doing their own things
and and a lot of times they, they've got, you know, uh when the holidays,
Well, that's true.
They have to see their other parent, I guess too.
Yeah
and sometimes they want to do their own thing,
so sometimes it's just spouse and me.
I know.
And, and you know what?
What?
Sometimes that's okay.
I know
Because,
That's what my mother said one time.
You know, right,
because who says that they just must got to come over to see us all the time for the holidays.
Right.
No,
that's true,
and if they force them to, you know that's not good either.
Yeah.
That becomes a drudgery
Well, do they all live in the area?
got, of the six, we've got four around here.
Uh-huh,
oh, wow.
Uh, you know, well, we're talking like north Texas.
Uh-huh.
And then, one is in Vermont, uh, Montpelier Montpelier, Vermont
Golly.
and the other one is in Everett, Washington.
How did they end up so far away?
Well, that is, that's, the, the, my little pair. And my second marriage.
Uh-huh.
Uh, and, uh,
Those are the youngest ones?
Yeah,
well, the
the, the, the, the fourth and fifth child of the of the, of the, uh, six are the two that are scattered like that.
Uh-huh.
Boy, that's, those are a long way.
And, Well, they wanted to go, uh,
How,
J R, my, my, my last son or my middle son, excuse me, fell in love with Washington state
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
and the, the, the, third daughter fell in love with, uh, uh,  Vermont.
Vermont.
So,
So they wanted to make their homes there.
Yeah,
that's where they've gone to make their homes.
My goodness.
Are they, are those two married?
No.
They, uh, just working up there or going to school or what?
Well, uh, let's see,
yeah,
I guess you'd say J R is working, going to trying to go to school.
Uh-huh.
I wish to God he would go back.
Oh, they do. Especially if they, if they're meant to, I think.
Yeah.
Well, I certainly hope so.
I mean, I've got a daughter that's a sophomore at U T
and I'm, I'm going to U T A right now myself
so it's never too late.
Uh-huh.
Well, it's, oh, I agree it's never too late.
Right.
And,
Especially in some of these schools around here, I think they have about twenty percent older students.
Yeah,
and when you're saying older, we're talking fifty up.
Oh, yeah,
I've seen some people that are really quite up there you know they look like in their very late sixties
Uh-huh.
and I say that's great, why not, you know.
Oh, my,
uh-huh.
Yes,
why not because that's a, a lot of times, well, it's,
I believe that, uh, we in that category,
and I'm not in that category quite yet
No.
but, we are seasoned minds.
Oh, yeah,
you're really ready to learn finally.
Yes,
uh-huh.
I mean, I don't know why I even went to college when I was seventeen.
Yeah,
it was,
It was a complete waste of money.
Yeah,
settle down,
we know what we're wanting to, to, uh, study
and, uh we know our limitations.
Right,
right.
We,
Right
and, uh,
And we don't try to burn the candle at both ends and in the middle altogether.
No.
We don't go out drinking beer till three and try to go to class in the morning
At seven,
yeah.
We're past, yeah, we're past that age
Yes,
we're, we're smarter now.
We know what we can do
Yeah,
right,
uh, so let's see.
So mine I don't spend a whole lot of time because they're not here.
Uh-huh.
And so the second question, forgot what the second question,
What was it, uh,
what do the trends in families
and do we approve what other, families do.
Well, uh, the trends in the families were to spread apart, do your own thing.
That's right.
But I have seen  lately,  yes, I am seeing, I'm seeing a change that, whoops, government can't do it,
A change?
I was going to say the same thing.
schools are not able to
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
and between a person's religion, uh, their, their faith in their maker whether, you know, uh, whether you're Christian or Jewish  or  whatever, uh,
Right.
Right.
and the family
Are going to have to solve some of the problem, huh.
those are the two that can,  that, that have the wherewithal
and, of course, Judeo-Christianity, uh, and of the Jewish folks, too, believe that the family unit is the one that was given the, uh, uh, mission by the Lord to do this very thing.
Uh-huh.
So when another group of, of, uh, people step in, try to do it, they're, they're tromping on our territory, so to speak,
so
Oh.
I firmly believe that, uh,

Okay,
uh, clothing at work.
Um, I work as a news reporter,
and  a lot of,
Oh.
I work in a, since I work in a small station,
this is my first job
Uh-huh.
and so, I dress very variedly if that's a word.
Um, sometimes I'm shooting and doing photography,
and so I'll be in jeans one day,
and another day I'll be on camera,
Uh-huh.
and so I'll be in a suit
and another day I'll come in
and I won't know what I'm doing,
so I'll wear a pant suit in case I have to shoot.
Yeah,
uh.
Oh.
So, it really varies.
I try to dress very comfortably.
I don't really like dressing up at all.
Oh, me neither
I don't, I don't wear a lot of makeup or anything like that.
Yeah.
I just,
I don't know,
it just, it takes too much time out of my day,
and I don't, I don't know
Yeah,
same here.
I don't mind not wearing any makeup
Yeah,
I don't mind it at all. Um.
Um, I work at a bakery because I'm a, still a, a college student. Um.
Uh-huh.
Okay.
But, we, we have to wear white pants and, um, any color T shirt, as long as it's not like a bright color, like a pastel.
White pants in a bakery.
Yeah.
Wow.
Yeah,
the bakers wear all white
Okay.
And we wear aprons and have to pull our hair back
and so.
What's the name of the bakery?
Oh, Italian I guess.
Yeah
it's Italian bakery.
And, uh, so, I don't mind having, having to wear a uniform, because I don't have to buy, you know right, as you know, many clothes.
New clothes and stuff.
Yeah,
that's one thing I would like, is just to sort of have, I really don't like uniforms but, just to have something I don't have to get up and decide what to wear.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
That just bugs me to death.
I know
I do that every day for school
Oh, yeah.
Yeah,
but I, I like to wear comfortable things like cotton and baggy things and.
Sweats and.
Yeah.
Yeah,
when I was in school, I was a sweat monster.
Yeah
All I had was sweats,
and when it was time to go out, I didn't have anything to wear.
Yeah,
I know,
I don't have very many dress clothes
but I don't mind,
Yeah.
I don't need them yet
Yeah.
Um.
Um, let me see.
I hate shoes.
If I didn't have to have shoes, I wouldn't have them.
Oh, really.
I just, oh, my feet bother me,
and they're just tedious
Oh.
to go find shoes for me, it's just,
I don't know.
I wear size nine
Oh.
and it, I don't know if just the shoes I get, I either don't like them or they don't fit right,
and I just wish that I could just go without them.
Um.
Oh, wow, I love shoes.
Oh, really.
I always  buy shoes
Oh.
Yeah.
Just the opposite.
But, um, let's see,
what else do I wear?
Um, if I were in a bigger market, when I do get into a bigger market, I'll probably go out and buy a bunch of suits and things, and, uh, where I wouldn't have to shoot and do a lot of other things
and I could  then I would be able to dress more business-like and things like that,
Uh-huh.
but we're all kind of just out of school at this station,
Yeah.
and so we're all, you know, still in sweats, really.
Oh.
So, it's pretty fun though.
I like the look, the, the like suit look, professional like, you know, look,
but I, I really don't have much of an opportunity to wear it
Yeah.
Um  I'm  going to be a teacher,
I.
so I'll probably just wear casual clothes, maybe skirts and some.
Oh.
Yeah.
I like this, the, uh, suits with the,
they come like with a mini type skirt you know, and the jacket.
Oh, yeah.
I like that,
but but I'm pretty short,
Yeah,
that is cute.
I'm five four,
and so that really doesn't flatter me,
but I think it looks good on taller people.
Yeah.
I'm five three
and
Are you?
Yeah.
Yeah,
any time I go to the store,
I mean, I, I have like two pairs of pants, because I can never find any that are short enough for me
Oh, really?
and it's just, oh, ridiculous.
Pants, too, I could do without those.
Oh.
Pants, shoes.
I like the like stretch pants, the cotton ones.
Yeah,
those are nice.
They're really comfortable.
Those are nice.
With a baggy sweatshirt.
Yeah,
those are nice.
And, tennis shoes.
My boyfriend's got me these L A Gear.
They're kind of big and hefty tennis shoes.
Oh, yeah.
And it, it's just like a chore to pick up my feet. Because I'm used to wearing the little white girl tennis shoes.
Oh
Oh, yeah
The little ones.
I have a pair of those.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And I'm used to those.
They're just sort of, you know,
like your feet
Yeah.
I mean, you don't feel them.
You put these things on,
it's, it's, you know, like exercise or something for your feet.
And I have to wear them because he gets upset if I don't.
So so, so how do people in Wisconsin dress?
Oh, yeah
Warm  this time  this time, of the year pretty warm.
Warm.
Sweaters and.
I grew up in New York,
and so I know what warm is.
Like five pairs of socks and,
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah,
sleeping in sweats or long underwear.
My parents keep the house cold

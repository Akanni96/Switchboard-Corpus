Okay.
All right.
Um, we have small children, two and four
Uh-huh.
and so we, our dining is very limited
I bet you're McDonald's fan.
Oh, we're past that now.
We're a little sick of that
Are you?
Gosh, where do you go, Whataburger?
No,
um, we're more
like, um, you know, like Wyatt's Cafeteria.
Oh is that right?
Yeah,
that way.
And the kids just love everything that's there,
so we're pretty fortunate.
Kind of, um, buffet style,  uh,
so you can  go in and go out
Yeah,
that's, that's good.
and the food's already served
and you don't have to wait,
and it's already in front of them when you sit down,
and things like, um, Souper Salads, you know,
it's, again it's buffet,
and it's already prepared
and just things, any, any eating area that you just don't have to wait an extreme amount of time.
I can understand that.
We,
We got, we got three kids, too,
and when the kids are small, if you going to wait, you don't go out.
No
They won't put up with that.
We tried a Bennigan's one time,
and it was terrible.
Course it was just probably one of the worst days to go anyway.
We, we waited almost forty-five minutes before everything was brought out,
and it was,  we were ready  to go home.
And you had.  And you had the kids with you?
Yeah.
And they waited forty-five minutes?
No
We fought with them for forty-five minutes.
I don't doubt that one bit.
So, we, we, we rarely go eat in those kind of eating, uh, situations, any more.
But we do love to eat out,
and, um, and we do it as often as we can,
and, and times that we do have baby-sitters we, we try and catch, um, some things that we normally wouldn't do, you know.
Where, where do you like to go when you got a baby-sitter?
Oh, um, let me see, uh, for New Year's we went to eat at Uncle Julio's.
Where's that?
Never heard of that place.
It's, um, on, on Walnut and Greenville.
What's the name of that again?
It's called Uncle Julio's.
What, what are they, what kind of?
Um, basically Mexican food.
Yeah,
okay.
And it's supposed to be very similar to, um, uh,
what is that restaurant off of Central?
It's a, um, it's a Mexican restaurant off of Central.
Well, there's a zillion of them.
Have you ever been to Mercado Juarez?
No,
but I've heard about it.
That's a good place
I.
Really.
They've got one in Addison too, now,
but the original was on Northwest Highway, uh, just the other, west of Loop Twelve.
That's a good Mexican place.
Really,
uh-huh.
Good, good prices, good, good food there.
Yeah.
If you like Mexican stuff. It's, it's a good place.
We like, um, seafood, also,
and, uh.
You, you ever been to Vincent's?

That's a good seafood place.
Really.
Yeah.
Really.
You ever been, tried a place called Louisiana Purchase?
No.
Well, this is in Plano.
They might have another one,
but it's on, uh, Parker and Central Expressway
Uh-huh.
and, it's, it's
Oh, okay,
I've seen it.
Yeah,
it's Cajun type stuff.
Yeah.
If you like it kind of hot, that that is good food,
Yeah.
that's good stuff.
We've been to, um, Chefalia's.
It's basically the same thing, seafood Cajun style.
Yes.
Where's that place?
That's in Addison, off of Belt Line.
Yeah,
okay.
Midway.
Belt Line  and what?
Like around, I think it's a little past or it's right before Midway, or it's right at Midway.
Okay.
Yeah,
okay.
And, um, excellent food.
Uh-huh.
So.
We got this Premier Dining Card thing,
and we've, we've been going to all sorts of weird type places with it.
What, what is that?
Well, you get, uh, one free
and you, you, you pay for one now, and type thing,
Oh, really.
and, uh, We've been to from barbecue to,
Oh.
there's a Swan Club which is out Central and Campbell.
Uh-huh.
Uh, that is, if you like continental stuff, that is really nice.
Talk, talk your husband into taking you there some night.
Uh-huh.
I mean it's not a cheap place,
but, uh, it's very nice.
Really.
And where is that?
Uh, it's on Campbell. It, it's north of Campbell, but, uh, off Central, uh
Uh-huh.
oh, it used to be a Northern Telecom Building in the in the ground floor.
I don't know what they call it now,
Northern Telecom kind of moved over in their own building.
Yeah.
But it, it's a big, tall, it's the tallest building on the west side, northwest side of Campbell and, just before you get to Campbell
Uh-huh.
and it's in the lower floor,
but it's really a nice restaurant if you like  Continental stuff.
Really.
Uh-huh.
And, tell him to take you there for your anniversary,
and then they got a place where you can dance, you know, and all that kind of stuff.
Yeah,

All right.
You got one coming.
I need an excuse

Uh-huh.
My wife doesn't necessary like that stuff,
but I like that.
Uh-huh.
And that's down in the, the Stoneleigh Hotel now.
Uh-huh.
And that is really super kind of stuff, too. Take, if you like Continental at all that kind of stuff
Yeah.

either one of those two, you go through a hundred bucks without half trying,
but it, it's it's nice, really nice place.
Oh, oh.
Yeah.
Oh, you don't have to spend that much,
I'm kidding you.

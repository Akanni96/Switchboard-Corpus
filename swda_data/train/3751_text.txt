Where are you, Bob?
I am in Plano.
Where are you?
Oh, okay.
I am in Waco.
Is that right?
Yeah.
Oh, okay.
Right down the street.
Oh, credit cards.
My favorite subject
You mean you use credit cards?
Oh, do I.
I bet you used them all up over Christmas.
Yeah,
mostly over Christmas.
Uh, I get in a rut with credit cards cause they get me kind of in a vicious cycle. Where you use them a lot one month and then you have to use whatever money you have to pay those off
And then your are in  debt.
and so  then you have no money,
so you use a credit card.
I understand that.
Yeah.
Uh, I probably have one of every credit card there is.
Do you use them a lot?
Well, uh, it kind of comes and goes, uh,
I use uh, Citibank, the, uh, Advantage one pretty much cause you get vantage points for every dollar you spend.
Uh-huh.
Once a year, I get a free airplane ride that way.
Oh.
So, as long as you pay it off every month, it doesn't cost you anything.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, that is a good idea.
Is that  that through a VISA?
That is what I,
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Huh.
But, uh, I got all sorts of credit cards for my business that I use
but, uh, If I can get away with paying them off every month, it is alright.
Uh-huh.
If I don't then it gets expensive
Yeah.
That is my problem.
I don't try and pay them off.
I pay, like the minimum.
Well you shouldn't do that.
I know
So I have got myself,
You never, you never  get out of the hole that way.
Exactly.
I have got, that is why I have got myself with all this trouble now.
But, I pay most of them on time and everything.
It is just the,
I always have them.
So, it is kind of strange.
Kind of like the federal government right?
Oh, yeah.
Exactly like the government
In,  In debt.
Can't  never get out of debt.
And every time you try to get out of debt, the economy goes to pot because people are spending money, right.
Yeah.
Have they put the cap on the interest rates?
No.
I didn't know if they actually did that or not.
I know they were considering it.
Just the people who don't need credit get the four and a half percent.
The rest of the, uh, and me, we have got to pay fourteen and eighteen percent.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Funny how that works, isn't it
The, thou who doesn't need credit, gets cheap credit.
I would be interested to find out how many people, or how much, uh, people use credit this year. Say in nineteen ninety-two as opposed to nineteen ninety-one, even nineteen ninety.
I think, I think it would be amazing how much, how many more people use it.
Well, I think so
because the,
Because of the economy.
That's right.
Yeah.
You have got to use everything you have got just to stay where you are at.
Exactly.
I would be very, I would like to see some numbers on that.
I think that would be interesting.
Do you, do you have any, uh, credit union where you work or anything like that?
Yeah,
I have a credit union.
Do they have a Mastercard or VISA card?
Yeah,
they do.
Uh-huh.
You have got that one.
Yes,
I do
Yes,
I do a matter of fact.
Who, who do you work for?
Uh, I work for Channel six.
Oh.
It's  it's an N B C affiliate down here.
I do a lot of work down in Waco,
a lot of, I call on a lot of my business is down there.
Oh really.
Oh, okay.
Where do you work?
What is your,
I sell metal fabricating equipment and tooling.
Oh, okay.
Tyme and Mercury and Tempco and all those people down there.
Oh, okay
Uh Gene
So you probably work with, uh, uh,
what is the boy from here?
You ever work with Davis?
Davis Iron?
Davis Iron Work,
yeah.
Yeah,
matter of fact  I just saw them last week.
Oh, okay.
And, uh, what else.
Are you in that part, are you in the south part of town now?
Well, I live actually in Hewett.
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
Yeah,
right outside.
You know Do you know Parker Machine Tool down there.
So, that is where Davis Iron Works is.
Uh.
Bobby Parker and, uh,
I don't think I have seen that one.
I am sure I pass by it or something,
but I am not sure.
There is a place in Hewett, called,
it is a new company called Prime Air.
That is in Hewett. Just around the corner from Davis Iron Works.
Huh. Prime Air.
They make, uh, humidifiers and uh, filters for air filtration stuff for hospitals, homes, something like that.
Oh, okay.
Okay.
Have you ever been to Marlin?
Uh, yeah.
I think it is Marlin or Mart.
They have, uh, uh, a place, I guess that would be similar to Prime Air.
It is called H G H or something like K G H or,
Oh, really.
Huh.
I can't think of it.
I can't think of the name.
Huh.
But,
I will have to stop in there.
I went, I have gone through there, uh,
my oldest son goes to A and M.
Oh yeah.
He is working on his Master's.
The Navy sent him there for his Master's. Mostly in engineering.
So, once and a while we go up six there rather than take forty-five.
Yeah.
That is about the last time I have been through Marlin and Mart
Uh-huh.
Oh, I don't like that drive.
I make that drive sometimes
we have stories out there
but, uh,
There is always a state trooper down there.
Huh.
You have got to drive careful.
Oh, really
I know.
Between Mart and Marlin, they will nail you if you go over  sixty miles an hour.
Oh, goodness.
They, they are bad at Hewett too. On eighty-four.
Uh-huh.
They are real bad.
That is where I got my last ticket.
So, of course, I couldn't pay that on a credit card.

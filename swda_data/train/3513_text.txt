Well, uh, let's see,
what type of car do I want?
Well, I'd like to have a Corvette.
Oh, wow.
But my, uh, weekly wages don't apply for me to have that kind of car,
so
Yeah.
uh, I'm engaged to get married
so, I'll more likely get a car for economic reasons.
Right.
Yeah,
and, uh, so, uh, to drive back and forth to work is all I'll need a car for pretty much.
And we have a truck,
so probably a economic size car or, uh,
What kind of a car do you have now?
Right now I have a eighty-seven Cavalier.
It's a piece of
My car is really old, too,
because, uh, I drive out of town a lot of the weekends
Uh-huh.
and, uh, I would like my next car to have good gas mileage.
Right.
And, uh, same here, uh,
you know, a nice car, American made
and, uh, you know, a, a nice car, but not too expensive,
because, uh, I couldn't afford like a brand new like Lamborghini
I hardly drive,
But while we're talking,
right
While we're talking, my next car, I'd like to be sporty and, you know nice,
Right.
but, you know, it's expensive
and then insurance is really high for that, too
so, Something with a, that's not too sporty because of insurance, then
Oh, I know.
Right,
that insurance does come into play.
I forgot about that.
Yeah.
What kind of insurance do you have up there
or is it real high up there?
Uh, no
mine just got lowered because I just turned twenty-one
and, uh, I'm not sure really how much I pay.
I just,
my mom's helping me out, you know, because I'm a college, I'm in college
and, uh, so I just give her the money and take her word for it
Right.
Right,
I mean that insurance is high dollars.
Yeah,
yeah,
it is,
so,
But,
And the more expensive the car, the higher it is
so, Unless I win the lottery, I won't be driving, anything too expensive.
Right,
yeah.
Right.
I don't plan on buying a car for many, many years
so,
Right,
yeah.
I have to make this one last as long as I can.
What's everybody drive up there?
Uh, in Kenosha?
I mean in Wisconsin, they drive them little four wheelers or four wheel drive
Oh, it just is,
or, do you all need four wheel drives up there because of snow and everything?
Yeah,
we, we have a Jeep with four wheel drive because, uh, because of the snow, you mean
or,
Right,
it never snows down here,
so,
Well, we don't have any snow here now.
Really?
It all melted.
Yeah,
there is no snow at all.
We haven't had snow yet.
We usually only get like once a year or so.
Huh.
Kind of strange to you all, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah,
it is.
Because, how,
it's like seventy degrees here right now.
Oh, don't tell me that
Yep,
how, how cold is it there?
Well, actually, it's been warm,
it's in the forties.
Really?
Yeah,
and that's, that's really warm.
Huh.
Uh, and it's supposed to rain tomorrow
so we,
I've only seen snow once this year.
And it was really bad
and then it all melted like within the week.
Really?
And now there is no snow,
so,
Huh.
But, um, so what, what is your dream car?
Uh, I haven't really thought about it.
I'm not too big on cars.
I mean, I don't know the names and stuff,
but if I were to go to a car lot and like look at them I would pick out one that, you know looked really nice.
Uh-huh.
What's your favorite color?
Uh, for a car?
Yeah.
Probably blue. Like if it, you know, was just an average, middle class car.
Blue?
But if I were to get a sports car, maybe white or red
Right
right.
Yeah.
So, what kind of car do you drive right now?
Uh, it's a Sky Hawk Buick.
Really?
Eighty-three,
I think.
Really?
Yeah,
uh, like eighty-two thousand miles.
Really?
Yeah.
Oh.
I'm afraid it's not going to last me that long
and I hope it does, though.
Yeah.
It's a two door.
I like, I like smaller cars.
They're,
I find them more comfortable to drive.
Right,
does everybody have their windows tinted up there?
Uh, no,
I don't see too many cars tinted.
Everybody has tinted down here.
Oh, I'm sure,
yeah.
I could, I could see why.
So, you been down here before?
Yep.
Really?
Uh,
Did you like it?
It was busy
Yeah,
it's different I bet, huh.
Yeah,
It was nice.
I remember, uh, swimming on Easter day
and it was like really cold up here,
but came back with a little tan,
Right
so that was nice
It's like, you know,
everybody freaks out when it

Kay.
Okay.
I guess we're talking about exercise, huh?
Yeah,
yeah.
Well first of all I, I have to ask you how, how old you are?
Oh, I am twenty-seven.
Twenty-seven,
okay.
Well, I am quite a bit older than you are
But, no.
I think exercise is extremely important
and I I do exercise on a regular basis.
You do?
What type of exercise do you do?
Well, I do, uh, jazzercise which is an aerobic, uh, program that,
Oh you do.
are you familiar with it?
Yes.
It's, uh, you know, a national company
and we have a jazzercise center here in Plano that has classes like all day long
so you can,
Are they different from aerobics
or is it the same thing?
No
it's really, it's an aerobic routine.
you warm up
and then you have thirty minutes of aerobic activity starting, you know, slowly and then working up to, uh, you know, a high heart rate
and then you gradually go down again.
And you do that every day
or,
No,
I only do it probably two or three times a week.
Oh, okay.
The minimum they want you to do is three times a week.
And this is a club
or, uh, do you belong to a group?
Well, it's really a
I mean it's called a center
and you buy as many classes as you want to at a time
and then you just go in whenever you can.
So, like I usually choose to go at nine thirty in the morning or a nine fifteen class or a ten thirty class in the mornings.
Do you go with friends
or do you go alone?
No,
I go by myself
and that's one of the frustrating things cause I can find very few people to go with me
Yeah.
and most of my friends that are my age don't exercise
or they might play tennis
Uh-huh.
and since I am not a tennis player, uh, you know, I don't get that,
but I am, you know, I am between, I am in my late forties
Uh-huh.
so, uh, there aren't many people, you know, that want to do that.
Oh
Most of the people that are in the classes are young mothers. You know, with with children between the ages,
Oh yeah
young mothers or,
Young mothers.
You know, young women, with small children are the ones that I find.
Uh-huh.
Well, what do you do?
Uh, I really don't have a routine.
I like playing basketball.
We just bought a new home with a basketball hoop
and that's what I do every day.
Oh, great.
Yeah.
Do you play every day?
Yeah,
pretty much.
When my wife lets me.
Well, now who do you play with?
Do you have friends that play with you
or just,
No,
I just shoot around by myself.
Yeah.
And, uh, that's about it.
I use to play soccer a lot in high school,
but when I graduated I haven't done much.
I don't have a problem.
I know I have to do more aerobics,
but I don't have a problem with weight.
I could eat all day and not gain an ounce
Well see, that's, that's really good
and I think that keeps a lot, some people from exercising.
Uh-huh.
I mean, I don't have a problem with weight either,
but I think I don't have a problem because I exercise.  You know
You  do exercise.
I mean, people are always saying to me, how do you stay thin
and it's because I exercise
You do it
but I also watch what I eat. You know,
Uh-huh.
but you'll come,
being twenty-seven, you don't really have to worry about your heart rate and that yet
Yeah
and I
but as you get older you will.
well everyone's told me my waist line is going to expand one of these days,
but I don't know
Well, it might not
Mine,
because everybody's been telling me that too
and so far it hasn't happened, you know,
and I, I just feel like, you know, you have to constantly weigh yourself and just keep an eye on it and cut back if it starts to get you know, too high.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
I guess I enjoy sports a lot
so that's why I've kept active in that way.
Yeah.
But you don't play any other sports but basketball?
Uh, basketball,
volleyball, uh,
too bad it's not really heavy as far as recreation or hobby,
I do that.
But, do you ski?
Being in Utah, I was wondering  if you ski.
Uh, I use  to,
but it got too expensive,
so.
Oh did it really?
Yeah.
Cause I know that skiing in Utah is, is suppose to be great.
Yeah,
a lot of people do that
Yeah.
and but, well I just I never find the time.
I had rather do other things.
Yeah.
Well, I have never skied before,
but I have friends that go to Utah all the time
and they think it's really
Oh they come up here.
and they ski.
I guess there's a place where you can ski,
well is it Tahoe? Where you ski from,
no
that's Nevada to  California  I guess.
That's in Nevada.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
I am thinking about where you can ski over the state line.
Oh, yeah
but,
But there's a there is a place in Utah called a funny name.
There's Snow Bird or Alta.
But it's like, Oh, Heavenly.
Is that it?
Heavenly?
Yeah,
I think it's called Heavenly.
Huh. I've never heard  of that one.
You've never  heard of that?
Huh-uh.
Well, maybe it isn't in Utah.
But they said they've skied Heavenly
and it sounded like, you know, that they skied really well, and when they are actually talking about a place.
It's kind of funny.
Do they exercise much or, I mean for skiing?
I know when I went, you can get sore easily
but,
Oh yeah.
You can get really sore.
I know you,
I mean I've talked to people,
but most of these people ski enough so that they don't get sore.
Oh yeah.
is one or two timer a year if I do go on them
and I am really sore after.
And then, is it your quadriceps that are the worst?
Yeah.
In your legs and,
My legs really, really ache.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But, that's,
I am using muscles that I have never used before.
Well,
and it's strange that you can do, like I did aerobics, you know, all the time
and then I went horseback riding
and still I was so sore
and I couldn't get over,

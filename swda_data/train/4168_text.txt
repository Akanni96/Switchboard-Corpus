Well, what were you saying?
Okay.
I, I think we're started now.
Oh, okay.
Uh, do you want to go ahead and start?
Uh, well, I haven't really been up to date on a lot of music.
I've been in school
and I haven't really gone out, and bought any or listened to much on the, on the radio except for classical
and, uh,
Well, you like classical music?
Yes.
Uh, I like classical music.
I like rock and roll.
Uh-huh.
I like country and western
Okay.
Uh, I, I like all kinds
I like, I like different things about each one of them.
Well, I like most of them except for country  music.
Oh you don't  like country?
No.
I think I, I might like dancing to it
but I don't like listening to it.
The, the kind of country I like is kind of the older country music. Not the, not the kind like Kenny Rodgers and stuff like that.
Oh.
That's, uh, that's a little bit to, uh,
they're trying to make it too much of a crossover thing,
you know what I mean?
Uh-huh.
what's the old country music like?
Oh, like, like Hank Williams.
Like the old Hank Williams.
Even, even  Hank  Williams, Junior is real good stuff.
Uh-huh.
The kind that
Oh, okay.
uh, this stuff, makes you cry it sounds so sad
I mean you
That's the  kind you like you mean?
Yeah.
sometimes I do.
I mean, not all the time.
Oh.
Oh, okay.
Well, I guess I, I like the blues a lot
and I guess you could say it's similar as far as  the kind  of the way they do it.
Yes.
And I  I, I do too.
I also like jazz.
Yeah.
Me too, too.
I guess I like
except heavy metal
and, uh, most rap I don't like.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You're, you're about like I am
I, I can't, watch M T V anymore.
I used to love M T V.
Oh, okay.
And I can, I can barely watch anymore because, uh, they have this heavy metal stuff on there
and, and I can't even, you know, I can't like that.
Yeah.
And, and I liked, uh, Aerosmith and Led Zepplin and, uh you know, and, uh, jeez who else is there. Van Halen.
Uh-huh.
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah.
Now  I like, I like groups like that.
But when you get, uh,
I, I even like Guns and Roses, some of their stuff.
Uh-huh.
But, uh, some of these groups now like Slaughter
Oh, I, I  really haven't listened to that
Some of them are just really rough.
So, so you went to school then in,
I'm surprised you didn't go to, to any parties or anything where they were playing a lot of music or stuff
or,
Well, uh, I used to a long time ago
but since I've started back into school now, I haven't really done that much.
I've been pretty busy. Uh
Okay.
but, uh,
so no
I haven't.
I, you know, I used to go out and dance a lot
but I don't do that anymore either
So.
Oh, I  see.
Are you married at all?
No
Okay
I've just been real busy with, with lots of other things.
Well, how old are you?
Twenty-eight.
Okay.
So, you, you were out of you went to school for awhile and quit. Then went back.
Well, no.
I, I went to school and got a degree
and then I worked for awhile.
And then I just started, I started back a year and a half ago.
Changed directions.
Oh, okay.
Yeah.
How old are you?
Oh, I'm, uh, twenty-eight
I was born in sixty-three
I guess we're  the same age then.
Oh, okay
All right.
Yeah.
And, uh, I didn't really start getting into music until I went to college because, uh, my parents didn't really have music in the house.
Put it that way.
Oh,
Were they religious?
Yes.
uh, I see.
I,
So,  I'm always behind.
I'm, I'm not, I'm never really up to date on all that stuff.
But I know what I like when it's, uh, when I like a sound. A certain kind  of sound,
yeah.
My parents were  very musical.
My mother had a piano in the, in the house.
Uh,
Uh-huh.
My father likes, uh, country western music.
Okay.
He's from, uh, West Virginia.
So that's what he grew up listening to.
Uh-huh.
And he's always liked it
and, and, you know, he's probably about fifty-three years old now,
so he grew up like in the late fifties
and you know, when they had that, the Elvis Presley music  and stuff like that.  And that kind of rock and roll
Huh.
Yeah,
yeah.
so he likes that.
And my mom always liked that kind of stuff.
My mom likes like, uh, Doris Day, you know.
Oh, really.
She always had those, these old Doris Day records and stuff  like that, though.
Oh, well.
So, you know, I grew up listening to that stuff.
Yeah.
But, uh, I could see why you went, uh, you know, I could see why you were kind of sheltered   I guess from, from music.
Yeah.
Well, I, I do play the piano, you know
Oh, okay.
But, uh, I, I like the, uh, early seventies, late sixties rock. Kind of stuff, the old stuff.
Oh, okay.
And, uh,
Yeah,
so do I.
Uh,
Do you like, uh, like Van Halen or anything like that?
Or how about Brian Adams?

He sings that.
Yeah.
He's, he's from Canada.
Okay.
I'm not, I'm not very good at remembering the, uh titles,
The titles and artists.

but I can remember this, the song.
Yeah.
Well, do do you watch music television, M T V at all? Or V H One?
Yeah
No,
I don't watch T V much at all.
Okay.
So.

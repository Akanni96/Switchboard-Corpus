Um,
So you have a son?
I have an older son,
yeah.
He doesn't have any children yet though.
Uh-huh.
Uh, he's thirty-seven
and I don't know if he's ever going to have any or not,
but I do have some neighbor kids, lots of little neighbor kids.
Uh-huh.
That,
I go out and, uh, I play ball with them.
You know, it's, because like this one that lives right next door, her mother does some work at home on computers
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
and it just seems like she doesn't have any time for her. Which is kind of sad, you know.
Yeah.
So the kids are kind of hungry for someone to play with them.
So I will go out and play catch with them or you know, we let the dogs outside
and they will roll around on the ground and play with the dogs
but, uh, actually I do think that the parents should have, you know, a little bit more time to spend with their kids.
I would think so.
When you,
when, when your son was at home did you, uh, working?
Did you work
or were you able to stay at home with him?
No,
when my son was at home, I, I did work
and then he went to a baby sitter that this lady had about five other kids that she baby sat, you know
Uh-huh.
but we always had our days off together
and we went camping on vacations.
So we had a lot of time together that way you know.
Yeah.
Well when my mom, uh,
when I was growing up my mom worked too,
but she worked nights and, uh, as a nurse
Uh-huh.
and so she was always home for us
Uh-huh.
and I always, I really appreciated that. Having her there when I was, you know, when I came home from school and when I worked,
but now when I look back at it, it must have been a really difficult thing that she did for us.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Well I am sure it was, you know.
But, uh, I don't know what the families are going to come to now days because they, there just doesn't seem like they do have time for their kids.
Because most, most of them, the father and mother both work, you know.
Yeah.
So, it's really rough.
Uh, I have one neighbor that's, uh, the father is a fireman
and he works like four days on
and it seems like he is suppose to come home for like three or four days,
but he can't make enough as a fireman to support his family, you know.
So, he's got a second job.
Um.
So he's, you know he's not home very often.
Yeah.
And that's, you know,
the kids I know miss that.
They  really do.
You know.
Uh, a family without a father, it's, it's, uh a really hard thing.
Yeah, you know
and I don't know,
I, I suppose they are trying to get through to them that well daddy is not home because, you know, he is out working trying to make some money for, you know, we can buy you this bike and that toy and so forth, you know.
Uh-huh.
But, uh,
Kids, I think would much rather have dad there than the toy anyway.
Oh, I am sure they would you know.
So, are you planning on, to having any children
or,
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
But we are,
we just got married like, like December,
so we are going to wait a year.
Um. Yeah.
And,  Then we will try.
Well  that's good.
That's what my uh, daughter-in-law told me. That they were going to have kids probably after two years of marriage.
Uh-huh.
And they will be married nine years this year.
So, I don't know.
She's a nurse, you know
and, uh, she has brothers and sisters that has got lots of little kids,
so maybe they just decided that, uh, if they wanted to have kids around the house they would just you know call one of their sisters or brothers up and tell them to send the kids over for the night.
Yeah,
that's a possibility.
You know.
But, uh,
Well, We  really want to have a family.
We feel like that, that couple you know, you are not giving enough of yourself
and  you should, you should be sharing your family. And giving your values, you know, making something better of the world by raising up good kids and letting them know they're loved and stuff.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh,
so,
Right.
Right.
Right.
Give them, give them an edge,
but, we feel like, like the first year needs to be devoted to, uh, making the family, the couple strong and secure in their love for each other.
Uh-huh.
Right.
Right.
But then,  a family is, is definitely a high priority.
Yeah,
uh, do you plan on staying home after you have your children
or do you, do you work or what?
Well, well I, uh, I am in, I am in a different situation.
I am a missionary
Uh-huh.
and I am home on furlough.
It called, like
I have worked for four years in Africa
and I come home for a year.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
And then we go back for four years.
But my husband and I will do the same job
and we will be living in, in Africa
and we will be working together.
Uh-huh.
So, uh, we will, we will share the job of raising the family.
I mean as a mother I will have certain responsibilities that he might not necessarily have
but, still we will share that job.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
But we have,
then we have decisions that we have to make that are hard about schooling, like do you want to home school your kids on a computer program you know, that kind of thing
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
or do you send them away to boarding school
and if you do that when do you do it
and that's a,

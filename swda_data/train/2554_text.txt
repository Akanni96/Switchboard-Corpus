Well, what do you think about it?
Well, um, most of the stuff up until now, in the recent months, I, I, I don't have any problem with.
No,
I don't either.
Uh, I mean it's,
you know it,
I don't think it's going to change very much
but
No,
I agree with that. As, as far as the, as far as the mess that's developing as a result, um, you know,
as a country, the United States, uh,
I think our hands are tied as far as, as, as any further involvement,  until  the U N sanctions it.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
In fact, it really was to begin with.
Yeah.
And, uh, I just, I heard a comment on the radio this morning that, uh, you know, it, it gets to a point where, uh, if enough people are, are going to be slaughtered over there over the, the, the internal problems, um, somebody may step in again.
Uh-huh.
But, uh, I really think it's, it's a U N issue,  at  that point because it is internal.
Yeah.
Well, you know the funny thing I find about American opinion is that when we have gone in to destabilize a government before, the American public goes crazy.
Uh-huh.
And now the fact that we're not interfering with the internal rebellion in, in Iraq, they're going crazy.
That's right,
that's right  .
You know,  I mean you can't please them one way or the other.
Absolutely right.
You know, and I,  and I think that, I, I agree with you,
this is exactly the right course.
I mean that's an internal problem to Iraq.
It has nothing to do with us.
Uh-huh.
And until he starts doing something so inhumane that the U N gets involved, then it's nobody's business.
That's right.
Um,
I mean these, these types of internal things go on  all over the world all the time.
All the time.
I mean, yeah,
I mean,
Some of them have been going on for, for tens of years,  if,  if I understand it right in places like the Sudan and,
Yeah.
Yeah,
and it's certainly, and it's certainly been going on over there for hundreds of years.
Yeah.
And it's going to continue.
That's right.
As long as you have so many diverse groups that are, that are vying for power, it's going to happen all the time.
Yeah,
that's  absolutely right.
I mean the Kurds  have tried it before.
They've gotten their butts kicked,
Yeah.
and  this is just another time that it's happening.
That's, that's absolutely right.
You know, they'll regroup out in the mountains
and they'll try it again in a couple of years.
Yeah,
it was just, you know, it was,
it's a very opportune moment for them to try.
You know you,
Sure,
and, and,  and I don't have any doubt that through some back channels that we encouraged it. You know.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
But, I'm not real sure that we promised them anything.
Uh-huh.
I,
that would have been stupid,
Yeah.
and,  and I don't think we did it.
Everything else we handled in this seemed to be perfectly right.
I don't think they would have done that.
Yeah,
I agree.
But it just, it, it really doesn't make any difference.
This is just a, a, another chapter in Middle Eastern history.
Yeah,
and, you know, and it, there are many of them.
There's no  doubt about it.
Oh, sure,
I mean the,  the British occupied the place,
the French occupied it,
we've done it.
It, it's happened so many times,
this is, this is really nothing special. Uh,
Uh-huh.
Well, and, and, and so many of the, so many of the conflicts, um, really don't have a basis in, in, uh, politics or, or human  rights or anything like that.
It,   It's, it's religious  based
That's right,
it's   it's mostly religious anyway.
and, uh, you know, by, by self-proclamation this is a holy war
and it is right.
Yeah.
And then, uh,  we, we go on from there
and,
Yeah,
exactly.
Yeah,
it, it's, it's a mess.
It, it's,
there's no doubt about it,
and, uh,
Well, I,  I, I think one of the big problems,
I mean looking at it from the the American public's standpoints, they don't understand the Middle Easterners.
That's right.
They don't understand what,
I mean their politics really isn't politics.
It's religion couched as politics.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
And there's  a big difference.
Absolutely.
You know, uh, we sit there
and, and we think that they think the way we think.
Uh-huh.
And that's a big mistake,  because they  don't.
You bet.
You bet.
Well, yeah,
because there's no, uh, you know, there's, there's, there's a complete different set of values.
Uh-huh.
Um,  there's, there's different value placed on human life,  and,  uh, right down the list, you know, possessions and, and everything else.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And, uh,  what's right is wrong and what's wrong is right in some cases.
That's, that's it a lot of the time.
I, I was stationed in, in Turkey for, for a year and a half.
Okay.
And it, it was tough,  understanding  those folks.
Yeah
Yeah.
You know, it, they, they're, they're so completely different culturally and socially and and religiously,
Uh-huh.
it's just, it was very strange.
I believe it.
It was very interesting.
Yeah,
yeah,
I can, I can, I can believe that.
Yeah,
I, I don't claim to have an in-depth understanding by any means,
but, uh,
Now I,
shoot,  I, I think some of these people that they claim as Middle Eastern experts don't, don't have a clue  sometimes.
That's probably true,
that's probably true.
You know they,  they sit there and, and read their books and then proclaim themselves an expert.
Uh-huh.
Well,  I'm not real sure that's, that's appropriate.
No,
no,
that's, that's, uh,
a, a little bit of background study has never made an expert in any field.
No.
But, uh,
Well, I sort,
that sort of goes to my pet peeve about the education system in this country, too.
Yeah.
And we make experts by reading books.
That's right.
You know, and the Japanese and the Germans and everybody else make experts by doing.
Uh-huh,
absolutely,
Yeah.
Absolutely.
Yeah.
I, uh, I, I guess you work for T I.
That's right, yes.
So you guys are well aware of the problems with the Japanese markets and everything else.
Right,
right,
that's an everyday occurrence.
Yeah.
It's, it's like our car industry,
the only reason our car industry hasn't gone down the tubes is because the Japanese, you know, came into it and helped,  us  out.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
I agree.
Yeah,
it's, it's, uh, there, there is, there is, it's an overall problem in, in, in this country understanding, uh, foreign cultures,  or  even accepting them.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, it, it, it bites us over and over
again, the,  the, the,
Yeah,
and  until we, until we start changing our educational system, I mean we're, we're going to be,
we're, we've already been overtaken,
but it's going to get even worse later.
Uh-huh.
I mean looks  who's, looks who's getting the engineering degrees and the, the math and the science and everything.
That's right.
It's not  us.
That's right.
You know, we, we've got folks running around here who get, who get degrees in basket weaving and you know, underwater psychology,  or  some, some ridiculous stuff  like that.
Uh-huh.
Absolutely.
And, and where are the engineers coming from?
Uh, well, they're, they're coming from various places,
and a lot of them are going back there.
Yeah,
exactly.
That's
My, uh, my roommate is a, uh,
he's getting his doctorate in industrial,
well, it's not industrial engineering,
it's human factors.
Okay.
His degree was in, uh, industrial engineering.
I see.
Uh, and he's from the Philippines.
Yeah.
And the only reason he came here was because the education is so much better for those who will go after it.
Right.
He has no intention of going back to the Philippines because there's no jobs.
Sure,
okay.
You know, uh, but I, I see it all too often.
I mean we've got loads of foreign students
Uh-huh.
and they're coming here, going after the hard degrees
and then they're going back to Korea and Japan,  and  Hong Kong and everywhere else
Absolutely.
and they're applying it there.
That's right.
And I don't know,
it's, to me it's amazing.
I don't know what we're going to do as a country.
We're, we're going to become dependent on these other folks sooner or later.
Yeah,
you know, every, every,
the, the country's got a problem with, uh, with quarterly reports and annual statements and things like that.
Uh-huh.
And  the long, long-range views are, are just kind of, become a thing of the past.
Yeah
you,
And, uh,
I don't, I don't think there can be anymore long range planning.
I think it, it's, it's sticking your finger in the holes in the dike.
Uh-huh.
You know, it, oh, here's a crisis.
Well, let's plug it up.
Yeah,
yeah.
I don't know.
I don't know what the answer is.
It's far beyond me.
Yeah,
that's for sure.
That's, that's the way things have gotten.
Yeah,
all we can do is keep plugging.
Yeah.
You know, I, I wonder,
I, I read in the paper just last week, I B M's unveiling their new laptop computer.
Uh-huh.
Well, at a price tag of six thousand bucks, I don't know if they're going to have a whole lot of takers.
No,
absolutely.
now I have the I have the I B M, P S two
Okay.
but I'm sorry I got it.
Yeah.
It's slow,
it's, uh, there are many better machines on the market right now for a,
Yeah.
the only reason I got it is because I got it through an educational purchase plan through the school
Okay.
Okay.
and I saved forty-eight percent,
Uh-huh.
so  I said, yeah, if I can have an I B M for forty-eight percent discount, I'll take it.
Absolutely.
But up to that point I had I had always said I would never have one because I wouldn't pay that kind of money for their name.
That's right.
But
That's absolutely right,
yeah.
now you watch,
just sure as anything, the Japanese are going to come out with a laptop at half the price with more stuff on it.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
the, the,
unfortunately the way the, the way the high tech market goes, by the time you can get, get something in your hands,
Uh-huh.
um,
It's already outdated.
it, it's, it's obsolete,
and, uh we're, we, we fight that battle every day  here at work,
Yeah.
Yeah,
yeah,
I, I can imagine.
and, uh,
I, uh, years ago, I remember when I had a T I ninety-nine. Put all the money into the expansion box and all this, that and the other
Uh-huh.
and, uh, things just kept changing so much
and I kept getting rid of them,
and I finally said, well, you can't do this
That's right.
You've got to buy something and stick with it,
so I so I just,
That's right.
at an opportune time I got one that, that suited my needs
and I've just stuck with it.
The only thing I've done to it is just add a, uh, add a mouse and a hard drive.
Okay,
yeah.
And that's all I plan to do.
Of course, I'm limited on memory now because I've got the low line.
I got the model twenty-five.
Oh, okay.
So I'm stuck with six forty,
but I'm not a power user
so it doesn't matter.
Yeah.
Well, that, that's, that's the key, you know, whatever works for you.
Yeah.
And, uh, if it does the job, then that's, that's what you need.
Yeah,
now my roomie, on the other hand, he is a power user.
He's, he's looking now to get rid of his.
He's got a three eighty-six and wants to get a four eighty-six. You know, this kind of stuff.
Uh-huh.

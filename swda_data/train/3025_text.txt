Okay.
Okay,
I, I do a fair amount of cooking.
Uh-huh.
And, and I love having guests to dinner.
I probably do that about once a month.
And, uh, I usually prepare something, depending upon the guests, you know,
it, it, I like to prepare chicken, that seems to please everybody, pasta or a casserole.
Uh-huh.
How about you?
Yeah,
those are things I like the most.
I like fish and chicken the most.
Um.
And, uh, most of the cooking I do just comes out of a can.
Uh.
Unless it is, unless it is, I catch a fish and I prepare it.
And then I just, uh, you know, I just broil it and put lemon on it.
Uh-huh.
Well, that's about the way I prepare most fish.
Uh-huh.
Uh, I made scallops the other night,
that was unusual,
and, uh, basically, uh, I found a recipe to make it in the microwave
and you sprinkled, uh, you swished around a little melted butter and do, uh, oh I do not know, microwaved them for about nine minutes.
No,
no,
four and a half to five minutes
and you had to add sesame seeds and bread crumbs on top,
very simple, but very nice.
So, if you are looking for a French recipe, that was good.
Sesame seeds and bread crumbs.
Sesame seeds and bread crumbs.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, my husband liked it.
Yeah.
And, uh, no
unfortunately scallops are one of the more expensive, uh, fish items.
Right,
uh-huh.
But, you know, I, I look for them to go on sale at the grocery store
Uh, one of the things I love to do, eat out.
How about you?
Oh, yeah,
uh-huh.
Do you have any particular places you like going?
Oh, there's a restaurant called String Bean on Spring Valley and Central.
Uh-huh.
I like that,
it's just, it's just home cooking.
Yes.
I have been there.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, it's kind of, kind of like Black Eye Pea,
but I do not think it's a chain.
Right,
exactly,
uh-huh,
and that's, that's the other restaurant Black Eye Pea.
Oh.
So, I do not really like, uh, you know, uh, uh, chili places or, what is it, Judge Roy Bean's,
or I do not like greasy places.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah,
I, I do not feel like they are very healthy,
and I always, feel like the home cooking places, are, are the healthiest meals.
Yeah.
You know, I tend to have chicken fried steak when I go, go to them.
Right,
and I, and I got, uh, chicken marinara the last two times.
Oh, how was it?
It was, uh, it was great.
Um.
Because that's, that's what I like,
I do not like it, you know. I just like a baked, you know, a piece of chicken
and then I get like green beans and mashed potatoes.
Uh-huh.
You know.
Yeah.
I, I tend to, uh, I get teased by my family a lot, because, uh, I like experimenting on, on food
and sometimes I go for fairly exotic things.
And my father teases me about gourmet cooking. Which is not always true,
Uh-huh.
but and the thing about experimenting with cooking or anything else, is that some of the experiments fail.
Yeah,
that's true.
Uh, the last time we had some, uh, friends over for dinner, I tried a dessert that sounded wonderful in the recipe
and it was just a total bust.
I was, sorry I did not have ice cream to fall back on.
Yeah.
Yeah.
My, uh, my brother tried to make, uh, a bunch of things, uh, way back.
He tried to make bagels one time.
Oh my that's ambitious.
Yeah,
and, uh, we took some
and then we had, uh, German Shepherds at the time,
and we took some and gave it to the dogs,
and the dog never, you know, he treated it like a milk bone
and he never did finish it.
Um.
He just barely made a dent in it.
Yeah.
Uh, and, uh, then he tried to made grapefruit citron one time.
Uh-huh.
It's, uh, supposed to be candy.
Yeah.
And, uh, it, it did not turn out very well,
it was, you know. It like made concentrated all the acid of the grapefruit into, uh, into a kind of a candy stick,
Uh-huh.
so, uh.
Huh, see I am not,
that's interesting.
One of the things I do not make is dessert.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, my husband accuses me of putting him through dessert depravation, because, uh, you know, we have ice cream, or something like that.
And that's why when I took, did this experiment for the company we had about three weeks ago, it was just a total fiasco.
Uh-huh.
Huh.
Uh, everything else was fine,
but that was a fiasco.
Well, you have to put eggs and everything, don't you.
Or,
Uh, yeah.
Yeah,
just about.
Yeah.
And I, I also don't have much of a sweet tooth,
so I can live without, live without dessert for the most part.
Uh-huh.
Use about half the sugar,
or make everything diet.
Yeah.
Uh, do you cook for yourself
or do you cook for others?
Mostly, I just cook for myself.
Yeah.
Well, when I was single, I used to, uh, I think my favorite meal was a, a baked potato.
Uh-huh.
And,
It's easy,
that's for sure.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
And, I mean, I never put anything other than a little butter on it,
if I had, or if I had a little cheddar cheese, sometimes I would grate that up.
Yeah,
I always put cheese on them.
And, uh, it's amazingly satisfying.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
but, you know, there's hardly any, I guess there's hardly any protein,
it's mostly starch.
So, it fills you up
and then the cheese has to make up for whatever the protein you get.
Yeah.
I I did not say it was nourishing,
but it was satisfying.
Oh, yeah,
it really is.
And,
Then you have to make a salad
or,
Yeah,
yeah
but, you know, I never really enjoyed cooking for myself,
so I ate very simply.
Uh-huh.
And I was, that's why, I think that's one reason I like having people over, because I could try things.
I mean, I must be a frustrated chemist or something like that.
Right.
Cause cooking is a little bit like, like being in a chemistry lab.
Uh-huh.
And, uh,
Except you get to taste the product instead .
Yes,
and have an explosion.
Fill them up
or blow up.
Sometimes it blows up anyway.
Yeah.
I, I once had a, an old boy friend over to, to dinner when I was recently staying with my parents.
And, uh, I had this wonderful recipe
and you were supposed to make a, a toffee like substance for a pie by, uh, boiling evaporated milk three hours,
and it does turn to toffee inside the can.
Oh, yeah
And, uh, the only problem was, when I opened the can, it just flew all over the place.
It was on the ceiling, on the walls and me.
And, and the boy friend thought,
it was, he was supposed to be there at six o'clock, not seven o'clock,
so just at the time all this happened, the door bell rang
and there he was.
And I had to have my, my, my, my dad sort of entertain him for a, for for awhile while my mother and I scrambled to clean everything up.
Right.
Uh-huh.
Did you let the can cool off?
Uh, I really do not remember,
that was about ten years ago,
I just remember how embarrassing it was.
Yeah.
And I have made, I have made it since, I've, I, and several times before
and I never had that problem,
just that one time.
Huh. Yeah.
And, uh, he, he was a gourmet cook,
he was kind of pushy too.
Acted like, he came from San Francisco
and he had a very sophisticated taste.
I, I really wanted to impress the heck out of him
and, and well, it was a memorable evening anyway.
Right.
Uh, as far as,
I, I do enjoy cooking
so, I was awfully glad I was given this,

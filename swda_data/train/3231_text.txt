Do you or your husband work for T I,
or
I'm a contract person at T I in fact involved with, uh, Data Switchboard
Oh, are you,
Oh, I see.
Well, that's neat.
and, uh, do you work for T I?
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
So, I've worked for them for several years, like twelve now, I guess.
Oh, you sound very young like just out of college
Right,
I try to,
I try to think of myself as young,
but, uh, well, have you seen any movies recently?
Uh, I'm trying to think,
we saw, uh, DANCES WITH WOLVES
Oh, did you?
and, uh, have you seen that one?
No,
I haven't,
I have, have a hard time with movies that are real long.
That was excellent.
I don't know.
Well, so oddly enough, I do too,
I get tired of sitting there, and so does my husband,
Yeah.
but we both just thoroughly, you know enjoyed it, just really liked it
Yeah.
Well, I've heard a lot of good things about it.
and, uh, I'm trying to think,
we went to see a, uh, a real funny one,
I can't think now what the name of it was
I've gone blank.
We saw THE NAKED GUN, TWO AND A HALF
Oh, we have not seen that,
we want to see that one.
and that was, that was pretty funny,
and then we saw,
what was the spoof on TOP GUN,
it's
Oh, I haven't seen that one.
oh, I can't think of what that was called.
We saw that too,
I was pretty disappointed in that one.
Were you.
Yeah,
but, uh, so, you know, through the summer,
we have small children, so we don't get to see too many, but we've seen I guess two or three movies this past summer.
My husband doesn't enjoy the shows as much going to them,
he likes to rent them
Uh-huh.
and so we watch a lot of them, you know, at home as they come out,
Right.
and, uh,
Have you seen GHOSTS yet?
Yes,
yes.
I really, I enjoyed that movie,
Did you?
Now I, I was real disappointed
Really.
I'm a real big Patrick Swayze fan
Uh-huh.
and, uh, I was really disappointed in it,
it
one,
I don't think it was as funny as what I was anticipating,
and I guess I was expecting it to be kind of funny and, uh, and it wasn't you know, at all,
Oh, yeah,
well,
Yeah.
it was, it was more of a love story
Yeah,
and, uh, so I was really disappointed in that because I like him real well.
Uh-huh.
We just got through watching one with, uh, uh, is it Claude Van Damme yeah, and, uh, enjoyed it,
Uh, Van Damme,
yeah,
I think,
I can't think what the name of
it was a, uh, of course, one of the typical you know, kicking, fighting lots of blood and guts and all that type movie,
Right.
Right.
Uh-huh.
and, and we enjoyed that,
and, uh, the, uh, uh, the one with Jody Foster, did you see it?
Oh, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS?
Yes.
Yes,
I did.
Wasn't that excellent?
Yeah,
I really enjoyed that a lot.
Yeah,
that was one that, that stayed with me you know, for a month,
Uh-huh.
I just,
I kept thinking about it, you know,
Yeah,
well, it's amazing,
but really, I mean, when you stop and think about it, Anthony Perkins didn't have that big a role in the movie
No.
and yet it was his character that was so intriguing,
Oh, it was excellent,
and, and, of course, he's such a, uh, very good actor anyway
Yeah.
and, I think he made the movie,
Yeah,
I do too,
I really did
Yeah,
you know, Jody Foster was good, too, but I think, I think Anthony Perkins was the one that, that really made the movie,
I agree with you.
Is it Anthony Perkins or Anthony Hopkins?
Oh, Hopkins,
I'm sorry
Hopkins,
uh-huh.
Hopkins,
yeah.
I always get those mixed up.
I know
I know.
It, uh, well,
I'm not a real big Jody Foster fan,
but I thought she was good in that.
Well, I
well, I haven't been,
I'm, I saw her in THE KEYS,
and I thought that was a pretty good movie,
but I thought she,
Now, I didn't see that one.
That was, that was pretty interesting movie,
and, uh, but, you know, I, I did,
I really liked the SILENCE OF THE LAMBS,
that was really intriguing,
and it, it didn't scare me all that much, you know,
and I, I don't like to go to movies to be scared,
that's not why I go
No,
no
so,
I like a good suspenseful story,
Right,
and that one was.
and that one very definitely kept you on the edge of the seats,
in fact, I want to, uh, rent it when it comes out for my husband to see,
because, he didn't
Oh, he didn't see it?
he won't go see that,
no,
Oh.
I went with, uh, our daughter and, uh, so, you know, saw it with her, and, uh, enjoyed it.
Uh-huh.
My all time favorite is WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S.
Oh, really?
Did you see it?
Yeah,
I've seen it.
Oh, I've seen it, you know,
we saw it at the movies,
and then we've rented it several times
Uh-huh.
and, we just love it,
in fact we have a ten year old grandson that,
he and my husband and I, we just sit there and cackle you know, just get hysterical.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
I've seen that.
It's pretty, it's pretty cute.
I guess, you know, as far as comedies go, probably my favorite is YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN.
Uh, yes,
yes,
I love that movie,
My husband liked that
Yeah,
so,
uh, he's a big Gene Wilder fan,
Yeah,
well, Gene Wilder doesn't do that much for me,
but I'm a big, uh, Mel Brooks fan
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
all his movies, I really, really .
He has a new one out.
He does?
Yeah,
uh-huh.
Uh, I have seen it advertised.
I don't know what the name of it is.
Oh, is that the one with, that's he's starring in?
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
Oh, yeah,
that came out, like early in the summer or something like that.
Yes,
yes.
Yeah,
I haven't seen that one either.
Yeah,
my husband wants to see that one,
and, uh, did you see that one that he made years and years ago about the, uh, the sheriff
Oh, BLAZING SADDLES.
BLAZING SADDLES.
Yeah,
uh-huh.
Oh, that's my husband's all time favorite, I think.
Oh, uh-huh.
I like, I like that one too, but I thought YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN was better.
Did you?
Yeah,
that, that was just, you know, had all kinds of things throughout the whole movie,
I just really enjoyed it,
and, uh, um, I'm trying to think,
because we saw another one that we thought was really good, early this summer, that was a suspenseful movie.
I'm trying to remember what it was,
because it, you know, it's,

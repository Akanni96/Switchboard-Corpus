Where you on the phone a long time?
Yeah,
I've been sitting here alternately reading and watching television
Yeah.
You were, he was waiting for what again?
To,
he called in to get somebody on the line,
it took him about half an hour to find somebody.
That's what this was
yeah,
well, let me go a head and push one
okay?
Okay.
Okay.
Well, basically I like comedy shows Uh, MURPHY BROWN, uh, DESIGNING WOMEN .
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Yeah
what do you like?
Well  we  don't have a T V,
I mean we have two T V
but neither one of them work,
Oh, okay.
so for  the last year,
I mean we just got married
and we decided well, for the first year we, we won't get a T V
so I mean I'm totally out of it as far,  as  T V goes.
That's okay
we'll been married eleven years
and, um, we went through that after about five years of marriage,
my old T V that I had from college when we got married finally went out
and we went, we made it almost about eighteen months without a television.
Really?
Yeah,
but then all of a sudden when you get one you realize, um, gee I needed that, you know,
Yeah.
and then you get to remote control the stereo phonic,  whatever  all of those things,
V C R, and everything else.
oh, yeah,
and then you never  use the V C R,
and now we have two of them
and now it's like we're just glad we never went out and bought a compact disk player cause we wouldn't use it
Really.
Yeah,
I mean it's cause your never home, you know,
you're working,
you're at school.
Yeah.
Well, I don't know T V shows,
what can I tell you, um,
basically junk that's on television
Yeah.
That's  my opinion
yeah,
um, I like things like I just mentioned,
have you ever seen MURPHY BROWN, or anything like that?
I don't think so
You don't think so,
oh, that's the one with Candice Bergen in it, um,
Well, see another thing was I worked on second shift for like a year and a half,
so. I would never see any shows any way
Yeah,
that would do it.
and then before that I was in college for four years
and I never watched T V then because I didn't have time.
Right,
nobody does yeah, then,
uh-huh.
I know.
I mean I did watch T V
it was soaps and M T V cause the girls I lived with never changed the channels .
And the, uh,
well I don't,
you're probably at least ten years younger then I am
but I could tell you in school that, uh, the only thing that ever saw in the dorm was, uh, the one soap opera, ALL MY CHILDREN.
Yeah.
And until then I never paid attention to soap operas.
Me too.
And to this day twenty years later I'm like, I'm in my thirties,
I'm not that old,
but I'm going, jeez, I can't believe that thing's still on television
I know,
I mean I I almost got hooked on it cause everybody would took about it at dinner and everything else
it, you know, it was like.
Yeah,
they, you know,
about the only other kinds of things I like, um,
I like to watch a lot of news, um,
don't you miss that with not having a television so far?
Um.
How long has it been since you've had one?
Well, about, almost a year.
Oh my God
Yeah.
Yeah,
you've got about another six months
and then you'll get one
Well,  I mean  I never really watched it much growing up
By then,
but I thought, you know, my husband would really like miss it because he, he was an only child
and he he's seen a lot of T V.
Uh-huh.
And I figured oh, no
it will never last
but. I mean I don't miss it that much.
Yeah.
Yeah,
my husband is an only child too
and he did miss it
that's kind of why we got back after eighteen months,
That's funny.
and I'm  trying to think about the only other show I watch.
I've seen CHEERS probably five times
and I've seen COSBY SHOW probably ten times.
Yeah,
I  like COSBY,
L A LAW is probably,
I've seen CHEERS
more then that I hate to admit
but, uh,
It's pretty cool
I like that whenever I watch it.
CHEERS?
Yeah,
I thought it was good,
I've actually been to that bar in Boston
it's a nice, you know, it's a pretty funny show.
Oh, you have?
Yeah.
Yeah,
I've heard it's pretty cool.
It's just a, you know, over priced downtown,  Boston  yuppie, you know,  tourist  attraction.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm trying to think what else is on television,
I know it's like.
I watched a lot of T V when the war was on.
Yeah,
who didn't?
Isn't that sad?
And then, uh, I like watching a lot of like college basketball and,  and  pro football,
Uh-huh.
I mean that sounds kind of stupid
but,  I do like  it.
Oh not, no,  I like the pro, actually I like pro basket ball as opposed to,
I watch pro football
but I like the N B A play-offs,  back  when like the Pistons were in them
Yeah.
and now,
where are you calling from?
Uh, Sherman, Texas.
Sherman, Texas, oh,
Where are you from?
I'm in Dallas
I  was just saying where am I calling you from, you know,
well then I don't know if you like the, the Mavericks or not,
they haven't been that good this year.
Um, we're supposed to talk about television
let's see
you don't have a T V.
So, are you really from Texas though?
Yeah,
I'm talking to you from Dallas,
uh-huh.
Well, sounds like you're from up north.
My voice you mean?
Yeah.
Oh, no,
that's just because I've moved around
and, uh,  I'm  originally from Pennsylvania,
Oh.
so.
I was going to say.
Cause I wondered if you really, you know, if had any teams you like watching from up north or something.
Uh, actually I'm a big Chicago Bears' fan.
Yeah.
Real big
and, uh, um, I always watch them no matter who's on,
of course you like them too, right.
Yeah.
Do you?
Well, I'm from Indiana.
Oh, okay.
Yeah,
so I like the Bears.
Yeah,
there you go,
and then  and,  um, I'm trying to think what else I like to watch on television sports wise.
I like,  I like tennis
I watch, uh, huh.
so  I mean I'm not, I haven't played in years
but, um, I just like to watch, you know,  two  players really get, go at it,
Yeah.
Yeah.
It gets boring after a while
but I don't,
go ahead.
I used to watch OPRAH a lot in the afternoons,  before I  went to work and stuff
OPRAH
and I see her every once in awhile like if I go workout at T I,
Uh-huh.
you  know, they have those T V right,  in front of  the treadmills,
Yeah,
on the,  on the tracks
yeah,
is
I don't know
she's not as good as she use to be
but,
Maybe cause she got chubby again or something,
her disposition's gone downhill.
Was she, was her show big when you where in school since you haven't been out that long?
Was what?
Was her show big when you where in college, since you,  haven't been  that long?
Oh, yeah.
It's pretty cool,
Was it?
I mean  back then
and the show, did you see the show where she lost all of that fat?
Yeah
I saw reruns of it,
She she wheeled it out on a cart .
I saw tapes of her
yeah.
That was so cool,
and then man she's really porked out again I guess
but,
Gee, I know
isn't that terrible.
Yeah.
I know
I guess with that money who cares
I don't know.
I'd eat too.
Let's see what else is on television.
Oh, if you don't have a V C R we just got one after nine years don't even spend your money on it.
Really.
Yeah,
cause, you know, if you like movies like we do you do it once in awhile
and then, you know, you see it when it first comes out if you really want to see it
and then it usually comes on television within two years.  You know.
Yeah,
we got,  we've got  the dollar Cinema in Sherman
so we usually see like first-rate movies,  right  away.
Yeah,
really, that's television
I don't know
in general on this project we're suppose to talk about
so I mean,
Yeah
I'm sorry.
That's okay,
don't,
I mean, I, I always .
Well, it's hard to talk about something,
it's like me talking about taxes or something,
Yeah.
I  feel bad cause I mean,  I should know  something about T V shows.
Oh, that's okay.
I had one lady one time
they called in
I just signed up
my husband had been on this project, um,
and I, I, she called in
and it was all about, we don't have children and it was all about, um, sending your kids to college,  and  why you would advise them.
And she was from Boston,
and she, I shouldn't talk about this but she was, pretend she was a television show,
and she was very snooty
and, uh, her kids were going to places like Amherst and B U
and I said I didn't know what that was
I she went, oh,
and I thought, um,
so I know,
I  mean it's like don't worry about it
television at least, you know, everybody's,  at  least seen television. During the war did you laugh when they had that man on,
uh, what was his name Wolf Blitzer?
What was that?
That guy that was a reporter for C N N.
Uh-huh.
His name is Wolf Blitzer.
Did you see it, him when he was doing the coverage of the Gulf?
Um, I might of.
I forget.
Was he the guy that got captured?
Uh, no,
that was the other guy from C B S,
oh,  what  was his name, uh,
Oh.
I  can't remember his name.
Yeah,
but what about this Wolf guy?
Yeah,
but just ,
they made jokes about him like on the CARSON SHOW and all of that,
Oh.
Jay Leno.
You know, what my absolutely favorite show is?
Uh-huh.
DAVID LETTERMAN.
I love that guy.
Yeah,
he's funny.
And SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE,
I use to watch that
like I'd come home from second shift and watch him like for an hour and a half,
he's great.
Yeah,
SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE has changed a lot if you haven't seen it in about a year.
Huh-uh.
I mean I haven't seen it in a couple of months
but,
Has it gotten better?
Uh, yeah,
actually I think it has,
I mean they finally like
and some of those people
they really have funny characters on there.
Really.
Yeah,
they have one character on there
they just call it Pat
and they, you don't know if it's a man or a woman
And  they say well, they're trying to deduce what he or she is,
Uh-huh.
so  to see if it's a female they say well do you carry a purse
and Pat says no
I carry a fanny pack
So you still don't know because a fanny pack is man,
or now days, you know.
Yeah.
Yeah
it's weird
That's funny.
Yeah,
it's, yeah it is pretty funny
I mean they do some crazy things.
Like when WAYNE'S WORLD,
I love that.
Yeah,
WAYNE'S WORLD, hey man
And what's that other one where they, where they do the, um, skits,
well, you've must have seen it recently?
Well, I don't know,
I've seen it off and on, I think.
You probably have some friends that have television
Uh?
I said you probably have some friends that have television
Yeah,
yeah.
That's where I've seen it
because I've seen it off and on probably.
You know, I mean you're not totally out of the loop.
Yeah.
I mean, yeah.
We, we bug our we, you know,
one friend of ours got rid of his because we motivated him because we, you know, cause we were getting along out ours
so he sold his.
But the rest of our friends we go and watch them.
Yeah,
I mean you really, you can do without one
but after awhile it will start, um, you know,
I mean you just kind of all of sudden
cause you're going well jeez
you hear about something that somebody else talked about,
Uh-huh.
and  you just end up doing it
but if you haven't been married that long, you know,  you're  doing other things
Is that on tape?
Is that on tape,
there you go,
yeah.
That's funny.
Oh, my
what else is on
I don't know
what did they watch in college when you where in,
where did you go to school?
Oh, Purdue.
Oh, that's a good school.
Yeah.
Yeah,
I know about that.
They don't have a southern accent up there though.
No.
You must be native Texan?
Why
do I, Do I have a southern accent?
Well your from Indiana, yeah. *your should be you're
Oh, real southern,
yeah.
Are you serious?
Uh-huh.
I've been here three years.
Deep one, you have a deep one,
yeah
Oh, wow,
that's scary.
It is, um,
at Purdue
I'm trying to think, I went to high school in Chicago, I'm trying to think what Purdue kids watch.
We watch, uh, M T V twenty four hours a day
and then every now and then they'd DAYS, they taped DAYS, you know,  and  watch it like four or five times a day.
Uh-huh.
Okay.
That's the girls I lived with
and, you know, other then that I'm sure they watched,
Do you know that I've never, I think other then accept on a commercial or on news coverage or something,  like  entertainment tonight I've never seen M T V?
Yeah.
You aren't missing anything
That's kind of what I've heard
It's pretty bad.
I mean that's,
yeah.
Especially if you have kids.
Don't let them watch it.
Yeah.
No
we don't
and I wouldn't even I mean I don't even have cable
I don't think it's worth ten to thirty bucks a month to pay,  somebody,  uh, to, you know, give me a hundred and fifty, um  channel  access to something I'm never going to,
No.
I mean my neighbor her husband sits in front of the television all of time
and they've only been married five years have a cute one year old kids
I swear to God he works from eight,

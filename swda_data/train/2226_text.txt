Uh, books.
Yes.
Mainly I read the Bible these days.
That's very good.
I do, too.
Good, that's great to hear.
Uh, and Christian literature.
Uh-huh.
Uh, I've kind of,
I used to read a lot of, uh, novels,
but it seems as though if you really want to set a side time to read the Bible and you work and and whatever, uh, that pretty well takes up your time for reading.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
it does.
It,
And I, I been praying that God would put a desire to read the Bible in my heart
and he really has.
It's getting, to where a just really want to read it.
That's good.
That's good.
It, it, it's, uh, it's hard for me to find time, also, to read.
Uh, a lot of times I do just read magazines and stuff like that for, you know, because I don't have a lot of time,
but when I do get to sit down and, and read, I like to read the Bible
and I like to read,
I read to my daughter a lot, too.
Do you?
And, uh, I like to read, you know,
I have Bible storybooks
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
so I like reading those to her
and she really enjoys those.
So that's good.
And it, and it's kind of short because we don't, woe don't have a lot of time, to, to read,
Uh-huh.
so, it's real enjoyable. For both of us.
Yeah.
Have you ever read any of Frank E Peretti's?
Frank E
no
I guess I haven't.
Uh, THIS PRESENT DARKNESS and, uh, uh, I forget the the other,
well he, uh, he's also written a lot of children,
how old is your daughter.
Five.
Five,
okay,
he's written some children's books as well
and they're all spiritually, uh, oriented,
Oh, really?
yeah.
What's his name again?
Peretti
Frank E Peretti,
Frank E Peretti
P E R E T T I.
I have to look for those.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
do
because, uh, I love to read his, his, uh, children's books just
Just to read them.
Well, that's good.
Yeah,
oh, they're good,
they're great.
That's good.
And it's like, uh, uh, usually about a family of, uh, archaeologists and the spiritual fights that they get into, like, uh, uh, digging in old ruins, and running across, like, uh, the old gods and things.
Uh-huh.
Oh
Yeah.
Oh, that sounds pretty neat.
Yeah,
it is.
It's real exciting.
Oh, I'll have to look for those.
And it also teaches them spiritual warfare you know,
Right.
so,
Well, that's neat.
Well, I I have a,
my daughter has PRECIOUS MOMENTS collection
Uh-huh.
and I like that because it's a, it's real easy to, uh, follow for her,
you know, uh, gosh, if, if I read straight out of the Bible to her she'd never understand any of it.
Well, it's hard for me.
That's right
It is, it is real hard to, to follow and understand,
Uh-huh.
and, uh, I've got a Bible that, uh, has a little bit of a, uh, a glossary in the back
and it helps explain who people are.
That's, that's about the hardest thing is, who's related to who
I know it,
and especially it's hard to keep your interest in those begats.
Yeah.
Yes.
Yes,
it sure is,
but, but it is good reading
and it's good for us, and and everything.
Uh-huh,
that's right.
I really do enjoy it.
But, uh, I also,
but then on the other extreme I like to read, uh, uh, I guess I don't know, horror, Steven King type books.
Uh-huh,
yeah,
I've read a lot of his, too.
The,
and I, I like that,
that's good fun reading.
Yeah.
Can't put them down.
No
you can't,
you really can't.
They are good
and ooh they just, they're just so suspenseful.
Uh-huh,
yeah.
I really do enjoy his.
Uh, there's another guy.
Oh, what can,
what is his name
Oh, durn
you would, well
you know when you're recording you can't
I know
Uh, oh, Dean, uh, Kratz, or Kranz
or,
Judith Krantz?
who?
Judith Krantz.
I know her.
Uh, no,
it's a guy.
Oh, okay.
And he, he writes the same thing, though.
It's that real, gruesome horror stories.
Oh.
Ooh.
Yeah.
That's good.
Yeah.
Koontz.
Uh, his last name ends in a Z, I know that.
Yeah,
oh, I think I know who you're talking about.
Uh, I've seen,
I don't think I can pronounce it either,
but
Yeah, uh,
Yeah,
I'm in a book club
and I think I've seen his books in there
Uh-huh.
I've never read any of his.
But they're real,
I kind of got burnt out on Steven King, though.
It seems like it's all the
did you ever read the, uh, uh, oh,
it's one of his first books, THE STAND.
Yes.
That, oh, that long thing.
I know it.
And that seems like all of his books have kind of come from that, I mean.
Yeah,
they do kind of follow or, Are similar.
You know, that,
Uh-huh.
I love that book, though.
I thought it was great.
Yeah,
it really was,
and I loved THE SHINING.
Ooh, yes
That was, that was my favorite.
Oh, those hedges when they started moving.
Yeah,
yeah.
Whenever they they made that into a movie, I was thinking oh, my gosh if they show that, I'll just die.
For some reason that scared me more than anything.
Yeah,
that is,
he just brings stuff alive, you know.
Yeah.
You could just visualize everything.
Uh-huh.
That's,
And that was a pretty scary movie, too.
Yeah,
I think they did a pretty good job,
but they didn't follow it exactly,
Yeah
but they did give it, you know, do it justice.
Uh-huh.
That's right.
But, uh, most of the time they don't with, when, follow books very well when they make them into movies
Yeah,
that's true.
I liked IT as well.
Yeah,
yeah, uh,
That's, another big fat one.
I did, too.
Yeah.
Yeah,
that was good.
I liked, uh, I also liked, uh, CUJO.
Did you read that one?
Yeah,
And,
except it broke my heart.
Yeah,
I'm a dog lover.
Me, too
And then, uh, NIGHT STAND,
is that NIGHT,
No,
it was, uh,
DEAD, DEAD ZONE.
That's one I liked.
What?
DEAD ZONE.
Oh, yeah.
That was a,
I've read that one, too.
That was a real good one.
He's written a lot of books.
Boy, he just sits down eight hours a day. Just like any other job.
I know it.
Right,
and then he has some under, uh, another name. That he's written.
That's right.
That one about the Gypsies, or that, hunger
Yeah.
or, uh,
Yeah,
uh, I think his name was Bachman.
He wrote under the name of Bachman.
Yeah,
Richard Bachman.
Yeah.
He is really interesting.
Yeah,
he's so prolific.
Yeah
Ooh, I wish I could do that
Oh, I know it.
And I have gone back
and, after I, I graduated, I read some of the old classics that I just bluffed my way through and have found that I enjoy them quite a bit, too, uh,
Uh-huh.
I do, too.
I love old, good old,
Once you can get into the language,
you know, the
Yeah
It's like, it's English,
but it's not the same English they speak today.
Right.
So it's kind of hard to keep, you know, at it,
but
That's true,
but I,
That's, that was one of my favorite subjects in school was, uh literature.
Yeah,
me, too.
I used to love those old, good, good old books.
Uh-huh.
I didn't mind doing that at all
Nathaniel Hawthorne is pretty scary himself.
Yeah,
yeah.
I liked, uh, oh,
gosh why can't I think of their names,
uh, shoot,
the one that wrote, uh, WUTHERING HEIGHTS.
No,
No
that was another one.
Yeah,
yeah.
Uh, well, you know who I'm talking about
Yeah.
Yeah,
those are good old good old books and classics,
Yeah,
uh-huh.
that's right.
Right,
right.
Sure is neat
That's why I like to watch that MASTERPIECE THEATRE on channel thirteen, because they'll take a classic and, and, uh, televise it you know, put it into a viewing format, more or less.
Yeah.
Right.
Right.
A lot of people just don't have time to read nowadays.
Uh-huh.
I know it's, it's really hard for me.
I work two jobs and uh, have my daughter and teach Sunday school and go to school, myself,
Do you?
so it's, it's hard for me to sit down and read,
Well, I can imagine.
but when I do I just, just love it.
Yeah,
yeah
me, too.
Well, I think we've accomplished five minutes
so,
I think we have, too.
Thank you very much.
It's good talking to you.
You, too.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.

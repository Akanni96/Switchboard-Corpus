Okay, um, do you like to cook?
Well, I love to cook as a matter of fact I'm making dinner right now
Oh, really,
what are you making?
Um, I, um, I'm making, some, uh,
I have a little turkey left from a passover which was in April.
Uh-huh.
And I had frozen it
and I'm defrosting that and making some dressing and gravy and making corn and wheat stuff that you can buy at a store, which is like, uh, rice pilaf,
Uh-huh.
but  we
with, with, with wheat kernel that,
And do you cook,
I mean are you single do you cook every night for yourself?
No,
um, I'm married
and actually the,
my wife is a vegetarian,
Uh-huh.
so  this isn't for her,
this is for our friends that came over and helped. helped me do some stuff
Uh-huh.
so,
Uh-huh.
stuff  so,
Uh-huh.
he  and I,
and, and she's having,
I, I do cook, um, virtually,
I cook most of the time because I,
Uh-huh,
well like if you were having a dinner party what, would you cook a variety of things, I mean, you know, vegetarian and nonvegetarian?
Yeah,
we, we, consistently,
if we cook,
if, if we have a dinner party we usually make it vegetarian just to make life easier.
Uh-huh.
So we'll make something, you know, uh, some sort of pasta or something,  you  know, homemade pasta or lasagna or something.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
that's something that's, you know, really easy.
In fact I'm having a dinner party next Saturday
and that is what I'm having is pasta.
Oh, good idea.
Well for,  for  Christmas I got a, um, pasta machine,
What,
Um.
and  all, all my friends are really anxious, you know, to have the homemade noodles
so, um,
Electric or, uh,
No
it's the hand kind,  old  fashion kind
Best,  kind.
That, that, that, that's
we, we bought one in Italy.
Uh-huh.
That's the best kind to have.
Yeah,
yeah,
Uh-huh,
that's real  good.
But, um, yeah,
so that's what I'm going to be cooking, you know,
Um.
I  thought I would
, um, pasta salad first,
and, um, then just something for desert, you know, bread and wine and cheese stuff like that.
That would be great.
Have you made pasta before?
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Um, so you know, so you know that it's a, a lot of fun actually.
Yeah,
yeah.
I,
A lot of people think though that I've talked to about it think that it's, you know a lot of hard work
and I said heck it's kind of easy.
It actually is, if, if, if you have a food processor,
I don't know if you have a food processor or not.
Actually,  it, it turns  out that if, if you really want to be nice and easy about it you can make the dough in the food processor really simply.
Yeah,
I do.
Uh-huh.
Right,
right.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
I making yucky .
Uh-huh.
It's also,
people think it's real hard,
it just time consuming to get all of the little things right.
Uh-huh.
Otherwise it's real ,
Uh-huh.
it's  good stuff.
What other kinds of, uh, dinner parties do you serve?
Um, well, I don't entertain that often,
uh, when I do though I, I have some friends that I always like to experiment on.
But, you know, um, I see a recipe and think, oh wow, I'd really like to try this, cause I'm single
and I live by myself,
Uh-huh.
so  it's not necessarily something that I would cook just for myself.
Right,
you didn't want to cook.
but, here we go
and usually I'm, I'm pretty good about it.
That's great.
Um, I have this really good recipe for this, um, pork chop and apple casserole kind of thing
and, um, you put stuffing and put poached apples and everything
and my girlfriend and her husband loved it,  in  fact she passed it on to her parent
and I was quite impressed with myself if I should say so.
Yeah,
that's how these things sort of make it for one person as an experiment  little  bit and little here and there
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Well, I'm the kind of cook that I don't normally measure things,
I just kind of throw them in
and, you know, I don't to the point of, you know, measuring down to the exact amount that they say.
That means you're a real cook.
Oh, is that what it means.
Uh-huh.
It's real good.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
we have a, we do, uh, uh, middle eastern dinner quite a bit actually,
Uh-huh.
No,
I haven't.
We make, uh, cause we're my wife is Syrian.
Uh-huh.
And, um, her families always have this food she grew up in,
and I've made some of it before as well,
Uh-huh.
so  we make, uh, four or five middle eastern dishes that are just all real simple.
Uh-huh.
We put them out for people
and that's always a real big kick for people who want, you know, who've never tried it before.
Uh-huh.
That's , that's, that's, that's a fun idea I mean if you ever, uh, want something different to try.
Uh-huh.
I would try that.
Um, yeah,
I've been wanting to take an, um, oriental cooking class
and I just haven't gotten around to it yet.
Oh, do you have a wok though?
Yeah,
Yeah.
I  stir fry things on occasion
but I'd like to know more about, you know, more elaborate things like guess.
Uh-huh.
it's  easy, um,
and the food just comes out,
you know, if you do it right I think it comes out, the food comes out very tasty not very mushy,
Uh-huh.
you  know, and, and it doesn't taste like a million calories of oil
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh,
really.
Yeah,
we, we, we like to eat even when we eat out and stuff we eat a lot of Chinese food,  or  Japanese food or, you know,  Korean  ,
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
and  that seems to,
so wok food seems to be our thing.
Uh-huh.
So anything else you cook
Um, I just kind of, you know cook here cook there
I don't have any one specialty
I mean I'm always willing to try anything usually.
Well, that's good,
that's always the way to do it.
I think it's, uh, .
And I, I especially like baking and making deserts.
I've taken a cake decorating class
and,
Oh, the Wilson course?
No,
no,
actually it was a private course,  through like a
I like it .
That's great,
I haven't the Wilson class.
It is, it's, it's neat but it takes a long time,
and it's like, you know, you bake the cakes
and then I guess just because I don't have the expertise to just hurry up and do it,  like,  you know, some, a professional would I try to, I go real slow
Right.
and, you know, it's a little time consuming,
Uh-huh.
but  it's really worth your effort once you see how you do.
Yeah,
oh, yeah,
we have, um,
my brother can do it,
Uh-huh.
he's,  he's, uh, got a degree in business management
so he learned to, uh, how to do this .
Uh-huh.
Can you hold on one second?
Sure.
Thank you.
Sorry about that.
That's okay
Some one kept beeping in our calling waiting ,
Uh-huh.
so.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
he, he, does that a lot,
So.
so,  you know, he cooks a lot  you  know, he bakes a lot whenever he,
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
and he baked us, he made a real big cake himself,
Uh-huh.
It was amazing
I never ,  could  do anything with cakes
Uh-huh.
and it's,  it's  just horrible.
Well, you learn helpful hints in the classes at least.
Yeah,
I'm,
You know, the instructor told us certain things about well, don't follow what's really necessarily on the box, you know, if you're making just a cake from a box, you know, do this cause, you know, make it a variety.
Oh that, that you mean about the,  mix itself.
You know, some different hints.  Yeah.
Well, that helps.
Some different hints, you know, and the different the different kinds of frostings you can make,
you know, and I have a book an it,
and, you know, all of the different, you know, decorating tips an things like that.
Yeah.
So.
Well, most frostings are sort of butter cream to aren't they. * to = too
Yeah,
yeah.
Those are, those kill me
it's like, it's like I'm eating sugar,
but they're good sugar.
Well, yeah
I think that's part of the problem,
yeah.
Yeah,
so that's about it.
Yeah,
I guess so.
Okay, well.
It was, it was a pleasure chatting with you.
It was nice talking to you.
Yes,
well, have a good time cooking for your dinner party next week.
Thank you.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.

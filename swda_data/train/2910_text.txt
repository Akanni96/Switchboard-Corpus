I think I get most of my news, uh, in headlines from the radio,
and then I follow-up by reading the newspaper and news magazines about things that attract my attention.
Well, I, I do about the same, I guess, but in a different fashion.
I, I, I'm from New York originally
and now that I live in Florida,
I live in the Florida in the winter and then go back up north in the, in the summertime
Uh-huh.
and I, I feel that the, the only legitimate paper although it might sound, a little elitist is the NEW YORK TIMES.
I've always read the NEW YORK TIMES when I was younger,
and I try
now that it has a national edition, I read that.
I also read, uh, I, I, I guess I do watch, uh, MCNEIL LEHRER on P B S because I, I lean to that coverage,
Uh-huh.
and, and  I guess I'm ,
I like them
but they take so long.
I don't always have time
Yeah.
Well, there
, it's a whole hour show.
Actually, it's an hour show each evening,
and, and, we, we turn it on when we start dinner.
We seem to start dinner around six and finish it up.
Uh-huh.
I find that I'm leaning on, uh,
I travel a great deal, uh, even overseas,
and I find that I lean on, uh, C N N quite a bit for concise and quick stuff.
And, I'm, I, I'm quite satisfied with the way they put it out.
I mean, I, I don't believe everything they say,
but it's, it's coverage, you know.
Yeah,
I think C N N does a pretty good job.
I had not watched them very much except when I was abroad, until the Gulf War.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And they seemed to have the best coverage.
They had more information sooner than, most of the other networks.
Uh.
Well, yeah,
I, I, I, uh,
Peter Arnet was reporting direct from, uh, Iraq.
I think this is scandalous the way everybody's picking on him.
Yeah.
I, I think that what he, he reported what he saw
Yeah.
and if you didn't like it, that was just too bad, you know.
Well, uh, I know that the coverage he was allowed to present was slanted,
but I think they said that frequently  enough.   That, uh, you  shouldn't criticize the man for giving us one perspective.
Yeah
, oh, yeah,
I mean, uh.
No.
Uh,
That, that's right, I think so.
And, and I guess when it comes to, um, to magazines, I don't read,
I used to when I was younger,
I subscribed to TIME and U S NEWS AND WORLD REPORT.
I, I have seemed to slide away from that and rely more on the local paper
or, I, I, I also subscribe to something called WORLD PRESS, which is a magazine that only talks about other, excerpts from the WORLD PRESS,
Uh-huh.
which sort of gives you a different slant, than,
it's not as slanted as the NEW YORK TIMES or as biased perhaps as the local paper.
Yeah.
But, uh, that I guess, and the radio.
Uh, I listen to P B S radio a lot
and I also listen to, uh, these twenty-four hour news stations, when I'm driving.
I,
Yeah,
we have a C B S twenty-four hour station that I listen to on the way to and from work
Yeah.
and,
Do you read,
are you from Southern or Northern California?
Northern.
I'm from, uh, the peninsula,
So well,
Yeah,
is that, what is that,
Palo Alto.
the San Francisco paper out there is, uh,  the major paper?
Well,
it's horrible.
Yeah,
and that's a terrible paper.
The San Francisco  paper is just wretched.
So I subscribe to the SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS.
Is that pretty good?
Palo Alto is  about midway between.
Well it's a whole lot better than that San Francisco  paper
and,
Oh the, what is that,  the CHRONICLE isn't it?
Yeah,
there's the CHRONICLE, and the EXAMINER,
Oh.
but they're, uh, both run by the same
Oh yeah,
they they really are probably the worse papers I've ever read.
I, uh, uh,
They're just horrid
Yeah.
so we read,
Well, can you get the L A paper up there?
That's a pretty decent paper isn't it
or,
Uh, we can,
but I don't like it.
Yeah.
So we subscribe to the NEW YORK TIMES and the WALL STREET JOURNAL and uh,  MERCURY NEWS.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well that's  another one I read,
I forgot that.
I read the WALL STREET JOURNAL,
not as in depth as I used to, because they, their articles seem to be getting even longer and longer
but,
Yes,
well again, I read that, uh, two  columns on the front.
Yeah.
I, I think I, I agree with  you that the problem seems to be they don't have enough time to do all the stuff.
I feel pretty well versed in, in what I'm doing because I, I do spend more time on that than I do, say, on sports, or although I watch that,
Uh-huh.
I spend a lot of time reading about these things.
I'm quite interested.
I find it very exciting to, for the coverage we have now, today.
Yes
and I think we do get pretty good coverage.
I don't feel that the American people is being shortchanged by the, uh, the news coverage.
If anything, they, I  think they
We almost have  too much.
Well, I don't know,
I, I hear a lot of criticism about listening to these, the Dan Rathers of the world and, and and taking their word for it, or their comment,
actually, they, I think they slant things
but,
Well, I cannot stand Dan Rather.
I remember him when he was a local newscaster in Houston.
No kidding!
Oh, wow!
And I hated him then.
I didn't know that.
Yeah?
And I would not watch that man for money.
Yeah.
And he and Barbara Walters just really turn my stomach.
Yeah,
was,  was he,
So I  watch Peter Jennings, and, uh and Tom Brokaw.  Sort of alternately.
Yeah.
How do you feel  about it?
I guess I, I got to say, if that's the subject, if the subject is do I feel that we're well enough equipped to,
I don't know
if, if it said that. I feel I'm well enough equipped.
Do we get enough news or something like  that?
Yeah.
To,
Do we get, uh do we get the news that we want?
Yeah.
And I do.
I really think.
Yeah,
I think  I do too.
I think you have to let, you got to segregate some of it.
Yeah.
Well, that's about all I have to say
Okay,
well nice to talk to you.
Nice talking to you.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.

Okay.
Uh, I haven't been in this situation yet
You know, my, my parents are not quite at that age yet,
so I haven't,
They're not  quite elderly, huh
No.
So I haven't, uh, really been in that situation although they are thinking about my grandmother
but, uh but that's really about it.
Uh-huh.
How about you?
Have you been in that situation yet?
Uh, not for my parents.
But I, I was around, uh, two sets of grandparents, uh, quite a bit,
we, we put one, I put one grandfather in a rest home
Uh-huh.
and that killed him
Did it really?
Well, yeah,
kind of.
Well, there was some other things involved
but it,
before he was really active
and the,
there was some,
you know, he lost his drivers license
and I couldn't get around and wasn't able to do some things
and so we ended up just having to put him in a rest home.
Yeah.
And he just kind of became a vegetable and died.
Oh, no.
So  but that was a long time ago.
That's  sad.
Yeah.
That was, uh, back in like seventy-three.
Oh,  okay.
So,  uh, I think the way they did things were a lot different back then.
I'm sure they were.
Yeah.
And,  uh, my grandmother, his, his wife uh, we also put her in a rest home.
Uh-huh.
She was in a rest home
and then she was back out because she didn't really need to be there and, uh, had a physical, had a good physical therapist at that place
and  they worked with her and got her walking and got her kind of taking care of herself
Ah.
and  so  she was able to come back home
Yeah.
and then she had to go back in a couple of times,
Oh.
but mostly it was just because she kind of gave up.
Um.
And they got her going again.
Yeah.
So I guess as far as looking, do things with them and treat them, treat  like they're ,
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
And I'm sure  it's, it's expensive.
Yeah.
It, it is
Yeah.
It is expensive.
Yeah.
My, my grandmother is not in a nursing home
but she's in a
Uh-huh.
oh they're like, uh, they're apartments for senior citizens
Oh, uh-huh.
and she loves that because they arrange activities for them all day long
Uh-huh.
and then they have, uh, where the bus picks them up and takes them where they need to go
and she, she, she really does love that
Uh-huh.
And she's just wondering well  what's going to happen to me
When she can't take care of herself.
and, and I,
you know, it's, I guess it's so normal to start to wonder about that even if she doesn't need that,
but you know
Uh-huh.
Now
she's kind of asking questions about what, well what's going to happen, this can't last forever
and so.
Uh-huh.
Does she have a,
is it like a kitchenette type apartment where she can fix her own food if she wants to
Yeah.
or she can go down to the cafeteria?
Yeah,
she can
Uh-huh.
In fact, I ,
because I, I remember her, in her letters, telling me she'll go downstairs for coffee or something to eat,
so I'm assuming it's something like that too.
Uh-huh.
So.
Yeah,
I, I really like that concept.
Uh-huh.
They've, they have a few of those, well quite a few of those places like that here in Utah
and, you know, couples can,
you know, husband and wife can, can live there too or, or whatever.
I,
and, and then, and yet they have their, their friendships and relationships and the, in you know, of getting together and eating together and all of that.
Yeah,
yeah.
I, I think it really takes, uh, you know, looking more at the people than even really the facilities.
Uh-huh.
And she lives by herself too.
She seems to like it.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, my husband's grandmother is,
well, she lives, she lives in a house on her own
and she doesn't really need the care or anything like that
but, she has her own home
and she's doing really well.
I'm really proud of her.
She's doing really well,
so we haven't had to do anything,
but then again, she has a lot of support
so I mean, she's got her mother in town too and things like that
Yeah.
Yes.
Well, I, I think that that's the thing that's a little bit scary, you know, a little bit tough about putting them in a rest home is it's, it's almost like
that, you know, they say putting them out to pasture
and some, some of the people that were there with my grandmother were really active.
Yeah
They, they wanted to do things.
They didn't, you know, they didn't want to go down and play bingo or, uh, you know, play with the oranges

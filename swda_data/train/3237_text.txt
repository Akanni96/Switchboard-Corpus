Okay,
so you said that you live in Coppell.
Uh-huh.
So what is your house like?
It's a two bedroom, two baths duplex.
Oh, well that's neat,
Brick and, uh,
Uh-huh
is it one you're renting or buying?
No,
we own it,
yeah,
well, our side
Yeah,
yeah,
well that's kind of neat that you can even though it's a duplex, you can still buy.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
That's good.
Uh-huh,
yeah.
Do you have any children?
No,
huh-uh.
Do you?
Yes,
I have two children,
and our home is really too small for us right now
Ours is, too.
We outgrew it when we moved in.
Yeah,
we moved from an apartment that was really small,
Uh-huh.
and at the time we just had a little baby that was five months old
Uh-huh.
so we moved into this house in Garland,
it's in one of the older areas of town
Uh-huh.
and one thing I really like is it has big trees everywhere
Uh-huh.
you know, lots of shade and squirrels and birds and real pretty,
Um.
but the, the house is real small
Yeah.
it has less than a thousand square feet
Oh, wow.
yeah,
it's real little.
You all are cramped
Yeah,
and now I have a daughter,
now my,
the one that was five months old is seven years old
Uh-huh.
and the one, I have another one that's three and a half and have all these clothes, and toys and stuff that we're just trying to find places to put,
Uh-huh.
Oh.
Uh-huh,
how many bedrooms is it?
Well, they advertised it as a three bedroom house because it has a built on addition room, you know
Uh-huh
Uh-huh.
but the room that's built on doesn't have a closet
Oh.
so, um, the people that lived here before us did use it for a bedroom
Uh-huh.
but we have always just put like our computer and extra toys and books and
Uh-huh.
you know, it's kind of a catch all room
But it sure is nice to have it when the kids come over to play
Yeah.
they all go out there to play with the Barbies and that kind of stuff,
Uh-huh.
so.
How fun.
Yeah,
that works out good.
And I'm thankful I have two girls, because they're in bunk beds,
and so, you know, they can share a room and, uh, make for more space that way.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
And how old's the youngest?
She's three and a half
Uh-huh.
yeah,
so, um, and right now we have their clothes on, uh, like double racks, you know, in the closet
Uh-huh.
we made a higher and a lower
Uh-huh.
and it works out fine,
but they're just about to get too tall where the dresses are beginning to drag you know,
Uh-huh.
and, um, we're going to have to figure out a new idea.
But we're, we're kind of looking around and wanting to move into a bigger home uh, hoping to be able to do that within a year or so
Yeah.
Yeah.
so that would be nice.
That's what we'd like to do.
Yeah,
is Coppell a nice area to live?
Oh, it's a wonderful place to live,
and they,
I don't have any kids,
so I don't really know,
but they say that we have wonderful schools.
Well, I think I've heard a lot, uh, about Coppell schools, that they're real good
Uh-huh.
that's neat.
Um.
Do you, do you hope to have children,
or are you not planning on having any,
or,
I don't think so,
no.
I see.
Well, do you have any pets?
Oh, of course, those are my kids
Oh, yeah.
I have two dogs.
Uh-huh.
Well, do they stay inside,
or,
Yeah,
they're inside dogs.
Well, that's, that's neat.
They're my babies.
Yeah.
Well, what are the colors in your house?
Uh, um, kind of a mauve and gray.
Oh, I bet that's pretty.
Uh-huh,
and then the kitchen's kind of a, a country pink and country blue,
and it's all done in cows,
Uh-huh.
I'm a cow nut
Oh, that's neat.
I like cows, too.
Uh-huh
Yeah
so.
well, our house was uh,
our house is very old also
Uh-huh.
it's like thirty-seven years old
Wow.
yeah,
and it was redone before we moved in, which,
I'm thankful for that,
but the,
it was redone at the time probably when earth tones were in
Yeah.
everything is
Yeah.
like, the carpet's kind of a tan and brown and has, um, paneling in the living room, and lots of, lots of tans and lots of browns
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
but the good thing is you can bring out other colors from that
Oh, yeah,
yeah,
you know, so, uh, that's worked out good.
In the, in the kitchen they put real pretty blue and tan, um, wallpaper had done it up with blues,
Uh-huh.
so that's nice,
Oh, sounds pretty.
yeah,
we've enjoyed living here.
It's close to my, uh, oldest daughter's school
Oh.
and that makes it really handy, too
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
and she really likes her school,
so
Good.
and we are so close to shopping
and ...
That's an important factor there
Yeah,
how about in Coppell?
I've always imagined it kind of out, away from everything.
Well, you know, now we have that new mall in Lewisville
Oh, really,
and that's just like a mile or two from our house
Oh, well, that's nice.
but, when we first moved to Coppell, it's what, six years ago, we didn't even have a grocery store
Oh, wow,
and now we have four
Oh.
and Coppell's not really big enough to support four grocery stores
Yeah,
yeah
so,
but it does sound like it's definitely growing.
Oh, much very much.
Yeah.
In fact, it's about the size now,
I moved down here from Chicago, what, twenty-three years ago and, to Lewisville
Oh, uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
and Coppell's now about the size that Lewisville was when, when I moved down here.
Oh, I see.
Well, when we first moved here, we moved here from Lubbock
Uh-huh.
and we almost moved to Lewisville,
that was our second choice, yeah, behind Garland,
Oh really,
we, at the time we thought we might buy a mobile home,

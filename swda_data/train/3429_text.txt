Well, um, since I'm in college, uh, I mean, uh, I haven't seen that much change
I'm kind of young still,
I don't know how much it changed in the last, uh, twenty years anyway.
But, I don't know.
Do you, do you have an idea of, of how much.
No,
I'm not that old either
Uh-huh.
I'm only twenty-nine.
Oh, okay.
So, social changes aren't that much for me either.
Yeah,
right.
Well, I can remember are from, from my childhood were the disco days
and maybe that's changed a lot. Uh the way, the way people dress
Well, yeah,
that.
and, uh.
I think attitudes are more lax now than they used to be.
More lax?
Uh-huh,
relaxed and laid back and stuff
Uh-huh.
and.
Maybe a people are a little more open-minded than maybe they used to be.
I think so.
Uh-huh.
I think so,
and a lot,
I think people are, are used to now saying what's, what's on their minds more more up front than they used to be.
Right.
Right.
Uh-huh.
Especially with like a lot of the different organizations now like, you know, Pro-Life and, and uh, Choice in, in the special interest groups maybe um, like amnesty.
Right.
Uh, yeah,
maybe people are a little, a little more, uh, free to express their opinions, socially free.
Yeah,
I think so.
I think women have come out more too, on, on like child abuse and, and the wife beatings,
Oh, yeah.
Right.
and and like you said, pro pro-choice and whatnot.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Right.
I think that's become more outstanding than it used to be where women, I think used to be a little bit afraid of coming out and saying something.
Right.
Just wasn't socially acceptable.
No,
huh-uh.
Yeah.
Uh, maybe, maybe too a big social change that's, that's maybe for the worst is, uh, is, is how, um, the people's, uh, views on, on relationships has changed, you know,
and now we have, now we have several, you know, we have to worry about AIDS
and we have to worry about, uh, maybe people are becoming more aware, more, more afraid of relationships.
Right.
Well, I know like when I was in high school and junior high and stuff and sitting down and having the sex talk with mom, you know and all that stuff,
Uh-huh.
and, you know, we didn't have to talk about,
well basically her thing was just don't do it, you know
right.
Yeah.
but, I'm not, I'm not naive, to think that my children are not going to not do it.
Yeah.
It wasn't that long that I was that young.
Yeah.
And I've got a ten year old,
and, you know, he thought, he knows about condoms,
and and he knows about AIDS,
Uh-huh.
and it's just different things you have to talk to them about now that you would never even have dreamt to have to say anything about.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Right.
It used to be that we were, that we were trying to protect morality.
Now it's we're protecting our lives.
It's a it's a much different,
Uh-huh.
we have, you know,
you can't just, just hope for abstinence.
No,
I don't, I think that's stupidity on parents' part.
I mean that's, sex is rampant,
Yeah.
and it always will be,
and and I think, too, noticing the kids, that the fourth and fifth graders, which is what my son is and stuff, they, they're just, they're more, they're very open.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
I mean, the boys are very open because that's, that's all I have is boys, so that's all I'm around basically, is boys,
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
but they talk about things that I, my brother didn't talk about until he was in college you know,
Uh-huh.
and, and they sit down
and they look at you right in the face
and they expect a truthful answer.
That's right.
You can't get them, give them, the, oh, you know, Cabbage Patch answers and stuff.
Yeah.
They, they,
that just does not go.
Right.
And they can tell me, basically some things that I don't know
Uh-huh.
But it, it's interesting, listening to them.
I think, I think the social changes in them, I think I see it more with that generation than I do with like our generation.
Uh-huh.
Right,
right.
Yeah,
I, I, I imagine you're right.
I, I teach swim lessons a lot,
and, and to see what, see what kids talk about when, uh, you know, they're, they're open about, well, you know,
kids are a lot more educated now than I think that, that, like we were, uh, at that age um, about a lot of things.
Yeah,
I do too.
You know, besides what, besides what they learn, uh, from, from our social environment is, uh, their education is just amazing.
Kids are, kids are learning, uh, you know,
their math is just,
every year, uh, algebra goes down a grade, you know,
and, and, uh, students learn it earlier.
I know,
well, my son, the, my fourth grader, he is,

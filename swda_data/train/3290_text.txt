Uh, the only work I do outside the home is I am an Avon representative.
Oh, okay.
And I sell family products.
Uh-huh.
And, uh,
Do you,
So I, I don't really, I don't really dress up a whole lot.
Do you work outside?
Well, I, I work, uh,
I'm a C P A
and I do contract work.
Oh, uh-huh.
And so, and I work with another C P A who just started his own practice
Oh.
and I work with him a couple days a week
Uh-huh.
and so when I go to his office or to other clients' offices, then I'll dress up
Uh-huh.
but otherwise it's great being at home in jeans or shorts or whatever
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
So that, that makes it pretty nice.
It's kind of weird because before I used to work, you know, full time
Uh-huh.
and, and, uh, it seemed like I was wearing a suit every day, just about.
Well, you'd have to dress differently when you're working every day, I think.
Right.
Yeah.
Right,
and so it's, uh,
some of my suits I haven't put on for quite a while.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
So it's, It's, it's very nice.
It's kind of nice to relax a little bit.
Yeah.
Gosh,
Well, my, my dress up,
I live out in the country also
so what I wear depends on the weather.
Uh-huh.
Sure.
Uh, so I really, I know a lot of the Avon representatives are portrayed as being very dressed up.
Uh-huh.
But, I mostly dress, I try to dress nice, but for convenience, because when the weather's bad, when I go into the home I take off my shoes which I try to wear something easy to take off, you know and put on.
Uh-huh.
Right.
And I don't too often take off my coat even, we really only have maybe three, four months of, I'd say warm weather.
Yeah,
yeah.
Well, I imagine that where you live, uh, you're in warm clothing quite a bit of the year.
Not really?
Oh, is that right?
Yeah,
and the rest is, uh, gets into the cooler weather.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Course, they keep saying the weather's going to change and we're going to have more Florida type weather up here
so I don't know.
Uh-huh.
But for now, But for now, we have a lot of ice and snow in the wintertime and, uh, cold weather. And that type of thing.
So you all are waiting for that
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Now, my daughter works all the time,
so she dresses.
I think, you know, you have to spend more money on your clothing, and that because you do have to have the appearance, a good appearance to do a good job where you work.
Right.
Right.
Yeah.
Well, down here it's sunny most of the time. And, uh, usually warm.
Uh-huh.
I mean, we had a few cool days, uh, this month,
but not anything, I'm sure, compared to what you've had so far.
Um, uh-huh.
So, I mean people are still wearing shorts
and and, uh, usually around Halloween it starts getting cooler,
Uh-huh.
so you start you know, breaking out a coat at that time,
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
Right,
yeah.
but, that, that lasts, you know, for a few months
Did you find you wore, uh, slacks when you were working full time
or did you did they wear more dresses and skirts.
No.
No,
never wore slacks.
No slacks.
It was, I think it was one of those things where, it's not like someone came out and said you can't wear them.
Uh-huh.
It was one of those understood things that you just, you know, either wore, you know, a dress or,
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Not even a dressy slack, a dressy suit, slack suit even if it's all,
Not,
No,
not, not with what I did. Uh,
Uh-huh.
Most people didn't.
Uh-huh.
Sometimes, like the secretaries might
Uh-huh.
but even then you didn't see them wearing slacks too much.
And I really, you know,
there's some nice pantsuits out
and and I wouldn't have minded, you know, wearing those especially when it gets pretty cold.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
But, uh,
I know my daughter mostly,
I don't think she ever wears slacks to work.
Uh-huh.
But I didn't know if the trend changes, you know, if, uh,
You know, I think it's one of those things where it's not viewed upon as being professional.
I guess they expect women to be in skirts or dresses.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Look more like a woman, huh
Yeah
That's right
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
And it's the men that make the rules
Uh, well, then you, you, you know why they make them then that way.
But, no,
we usually, you know,
skirt and, skirt and blouse or suit or dress is what you see down here.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
So it's nice with me working at home because I can wear pants.
Yeah.
No, no one can see me unless I'm, you know,
Yeah.
But, yet, you need to keep up an appearance for your husband, too, though at home. Because that's, I, I believe,
Yeah.
Yeah.
But, I'm not going to put a skirt on just for him
Oh, you don't think you will, huh
Well, you'll be excused because considering everything
Yeah,
I think that the main issue at home is being comfortable in your clothing
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
But I, I look at homemaking as a job also. Uh, being a homemaker
Right.
and I, I think sometimes we lose sight of that. Uh, by the fact that we don't sometimes watch our dress,
Yeah.

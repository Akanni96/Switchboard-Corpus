All right.
Uh, exercise huh
Yeah.
Uh, as a matter fact, I work out in the mornings.
I belong to Presidents.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, I have got a routine for every morning of the week
and I don't work out on Saturday or Sunday
Uh-huh.
but, uh, I do, I do a combination of, uh, uh, running and weight training
They set that up for you.
No,
I, uh, actually I just, uh, joined on my own
and I have been thinking about getting with a, uh, one of their counselors just so see what, uh, they might have to offer as far as, uh, alternatives.
Uh-huh.
But, I pretty much, uh, worked on my own routine.
And, uh, what kind of running do you do?
They have got the track on the inside.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, I run one mile on Monday, Wednesdays and Fridays
and then on Tuesdays and Thursdays, I run two miles.
Uh-huh.
And then after that, I work out with weights.
Is is just aerobics
or,
Uh, I work out with free weights.
No,
uh, I mean the running.
Oh, uh, yeah.
It is really the, uh, aerobic work out part.
You do it, you do a mile in about eight minutes or less?
Uh, about seven minutes.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Then you wouldn't, then you don't get, uh, out of breath.
Uh, no
I do
Oh.
Yeah,
that is, that is a pretty good clip
and I am pretty winded by the time I get done.
Oh.
So,
But, I mean it's not pushing it real hard, like, you know, if you tried to make six or something like that.
Oh, yeah.
I, I, uh, could probably go faster,
but then I would wear myself out
Right.
And I wouldn't be able to work out anything else.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
How about you?
Yeah,
I, I don't run much any more.
I did when I was in school.
Uh-huh.
Right now I just lift, uh, weights and do push ups and sit ups
Uh-huh.
and, and I, uh, jump rope a little bit
Uh-huh.
and that is about it
Yeah.
And I don't, I don't lift any heavy weight, uh,
they are about a third of my body weight.
Oh, I see.
So this, uh,
do you just try and keep them, I guess, uh, firm and, uh,
Yeah
and uh, uh, I play the trumpet
and the, uh, the more upper body strength, the easier it is to play.
Yeah,
uh,  that is true.
You have  to do a whole lot of sit ups
and, uh, and then, uh, I hurt my neck, uh, about three years ago.
Yeah.
So, you really have to build up around your neck and your shoulders to keep from, uh, hurting yourself when you play high.
Oh, I see.
You have to, you have to do it correctly, you know,
it is like an exercise in itself,
but a lot of people, uh, strain themselves doing it.
Oh, I see.
Uh, so you are in, uh, in part of a band?
Uh, I play at Church.
Oh, I see,
I see
I use to play an instrument when I was in high school,
but it wasn't the trumpet
Yeah.
So, I was just wandering if that was what it was or something.
I think,
Uh-huh
So do you have any plans of maybe running more when the weather gets nicer?
Well, yeah,
uh, well the weather is nice except for when it rains, you know I mean in Dallas.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I keep thinking about it,
but that doesn't mean it gets done.
I, I mostly jump rope more.
Uh-huh.
You know.
Yeah,
I use to do a little bit of jumping rope, uh, when I was, uh,
well a while back I was more into basketball
Uh-huh.
and, uh, I could do a lot of jump rope and other jumping exercises to try to build my calves.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, but, it has been a while since I have done that.
Yeah.
I do a toe lift and squats for that.
Right.
But you know it, it doesn't, uh, doesn't, uh, accustom your legs to the kind of strength that you have like when you are running for a long time.
Right.
They tend to tighten up whenever, whenever you have to do something at, uh, uh, great length of time.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
I, I, uh, that is true.
I have noticed that, uh,
And it also builds too much mass if you just, you know.
Uh-huh.
So, it is like, I, I lift weights with about the same curl weight as I do the squats with.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, then it doesn't bother me very much.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Huh. That is interesting though.
Uh, I have been thinking of changing, uh,
I have done the same routine for almost two years now
and I am thinking of, uh, changing it up.
Uh-huh.
Uh, that is why, well, you know, I was thinking to talking to one of their counselors and seeing what different exercises they could get me on to, uh, get out of the routine.
Right.
Because I have heard that, you know, you get locked into a routine then you are going to get to a point where you just stop developing.
Uh-huh.
So, I am looking at changing things a little bit.
Yeah,
that is, uh, I have started doing more push ups
and, and it has helped a lot
and then I add sets to it so that I don't like you said, wear it out.
Uh-huh.
I don't try to push it so the end in one set.
Yeah.

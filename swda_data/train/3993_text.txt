Okay
what, do you do artistic painting?
Uh, I do tole painting.
Oh, you do?
Uh-huh,
I really love the tole painting.
Uh, I haven't done any of the oil or watercolor.
I would like to learn that someday,
but right now my passion is tole painting
Do you do a lot of it?
Uh-huh.
I, I took one class about, I guess three or four years ago
and I've done a little, uh,
Oh.
But it takes a lot of time
It does,
it is real time consuming
and,
do you sell your projects?
Uh, mostly I have just given them away as gifts.
Uh-huh.
Uh, I've done, uh, perpetual calendars and cookie jar lids and, oh, on and on, you know, just things like that,
but uh, I would eventually like to make enough to sell and quit my job
Uh-huh.
Where do you work at?
I just work at Stop and Shop out there in, in Ogden
so,
Now do you ever send any of your stuff to the boutique?
No,
I've wanted to do that, uh, but just haven't, just haven't mass produced enough to do that.
Uh-huh.
So, I have five children of my own,
so it's
That keeps you busy.
they, they keep me busy
and tole painting is just a, you know, something I do in my spare time
so
Uh-huh.
Have you tried any of the,
well, do you cut out your own projects?
Yes,
uh-huh,
I have my own saws
and so I really enjoy doing that.
Huh. Do you, uh, ever spray your projects with the, I mean a base coat first
or do you brush it on?
I brush it on,
yeah,
I haven't tried a, a spray varnish.
I use just a wood sealer.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
I just bought a spray gun, one of those airless, uh, not airless, high volume, low pressure spray guns.
Oh, uh-huh.
And I do a lot of woodworking
and that's what I bought it for.
Do you?
Oh.
But I haven't used it yet.
Oh, well that's that 'ud probably give you a smoother finish, wouldn't it?
Yeah.
Oh.
Yeah.
Now what type of woodworking do you do?
Uh, fine furniture.
Oh  do you?
Yeah.
That's why I brought, bought the sprayer is to finish my projects.
Oh.
That's my worst, worst part of my woodworking.
I get so sick of making
Oh, but it's hard to finish it, huh.
Yeah,
but spraying does put on a nicer finish.
Oh, well, that is interesting.
So, what kind of equipment do you have?
For woodworking?
Uh-huh.
Uh, let me see,
table saw, scroll saw, band saw, lathe, routers,
and about it.
Boy, it sounds like you're really into it.
That is nice.
Yeah,
it is.
Yeah,
I, I just have a scroll saw and a jig saw
and I am really anxious to get a band saw and a router
Yeah,
the band saw is really nice.
I have an Inca.
I don't know if you've ever heard of those.
Oh.
But it's nice to have the right equipment.
Yeah,
that is, that makes it easier, doesn't it?
Uh-huh.
Well, have you sold any of your furniture
or just,
Uh
not,
mostly I do like you do, give it away as gifts.
Uh-huh.
But, Making my own furniture.
Yeah.
Oh, that's interesting.
Do you, uh, did you take classes to learn how to do that?
Uh, just in junior high
Uh-huh.
and then I just kept on through high school and then got my own equipment, kept up with that.
Oh, so yours is mostly just a hobby, too, then.
Yeah.
Oh.
Yeah.
Well, that is interesting.
Oh, I would, I really would love to go take a class in woodworking and learn how to.
I don't know if I necessarily want to do furniture,
but mostly, uh, just do more,
Like the shelves and,
Uh-huh,
the woodworking.
For your tole painting.
Uh,
Yeah
Yeah,
so, it's fun
Good.
Well I guess I'll let you go now.
Well, they come on,
we're supposed to talk until they come on and tell us
Oh, they do?
Okay,
so this is my first one.
You're probably a veteran at this.
Yeah.
Well, it has, it has been really fun.
I've enjoyed this. Uh,
like I say, I've made a couple of calls to Texas, and just talked to all different kinds of people
Uh-huh.
so I think you'll enjoy doing it.
Yeah.
It's fun.
Sounds fun.
Where do you buy your tole painting paints at around here?
Uh, you know, there's a shop in Roy that I really love.
Uh, and it's there by the, Copper Mill restaurant, used to be the Hayloft.
I am not
well, we live in Roy
, but, we
is it on nineteen hundred?
Uh-huh.
Uh, let's see,
I'm trying to think of the name.
I know where fifty-six hundred south is.
Uh, I don't right off.

Ben Franklin,
okay.

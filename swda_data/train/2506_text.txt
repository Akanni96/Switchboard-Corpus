So, tell me about your home.
My home.
All right,
my home is about fifteen years old.
All right.
It's a two story house,
it, it's our first home,
and it looks like it's going to be the last,
I think we're going to demolish it
We've got two children
and it's,
they have scraped the, uh, plaster off the walls, you know, with riding their little toys through it and stuff. You know,
Yes.
put dents in the tiles, just multitude of them,
I mean even places,
it's, it's past the dent stage,
we're talking some of it's been peeled away, you know,
I don't know what they,
We talking from, from dents in the holes.
Yeah,
dents in the hole ,
right.
I understand,
we've got, I've got a daughter.
We've got two,
one of them's eleven
and one of them's seven
and then the carpet, you know,
we need to replace the carpet.
I mean, it sounds like it's just the pits
but it's not all that bad, I guess
but, you know, they're just real hard on it.
Kids are hard on houses.
Definitely,
I can see why people wait until they get like in high school or maybe junior high
and then they get another one.
Yeah,
yeah.
Uh, we live in a mobile home
and that's probably not typical America
but,
I know there's a lot of them.
it's,
what we have,
it's all we can afford.
Yeah.
And, uh, seems like we're always working on it, as I'm sure, it is with your house.
Because they're always, because they're always ruining something?
Yeah.
How old is your child?
Ten,
girl.
Well,
So, you know, just like yours, ours is always, you know,
we're,
something else goes wrong always, you know,
it's,
Some appliances breaking or something?
No,
appliances,
we had a couple plumbing problems,
we've, oh,
who knows, you know, it's always something with homes.
And you said you were in Colorado Springs?
Yes.
Are there a lot of trailers around there?
Yeah,
there are there's a big military constituency.
And is that what you're in?
Oh, no,
no
I'm, I work for T I.
Well, then that's why you're doing this then, isn't it?
Oh, yes.
Oh, okay,
well,
What division are you in?
I'm not in T I.
Oh.
I had a friend that had a roommate that worked for T I
and she saw this come up on the computer screen, and ran it off. And passed it to the people that were interested.
It's not a hobby, you know,
it's something to do.
I get to here about Texas again a bit and get to talk to people all over the country,
you know, that I've talked to someone in Maryland, I believe it was.
I know, I've been talking to people in Ohio, and, uh, Virginia, and I think, California.
It's interesting, isn't it?
Yeah,
it is.
You know, the gal I talked to in Maryland, didn't own a car,
she's never traveled anywhere,
she's never been anywhere,
she, you know,
I talked about one of the biggest problems in the United States being our roads,
and she didn't understand.
She doesn't drive.
How does she get to work?
Uh, she, uh, lives on campus,
she's a college student.
Buses and, and, uh, public transportation.
Uh-huh.
I had a
Her, her parents live by the public transportation.
and I wish we could down here.
Well, it would be nice
but I kind of like the freedom, too, don't you?
Well, sometimes
but I tell you I'd sure like to be able to get on a bus or something and get to work,
but if I did it, it would take me an hour and fifteen minutes.
I would have to get on one and drive, or walk to a you know,
there's one terminal close to us
and then they'd drive me to the main terminal here,
Right.
then, I'd have to go to downtown Dallas and then walk over couple blocks and get on another bus to go to my school.
If it's anything like, uh,
So that's too much.
Dallas always has been,
no one wants to be at downtown Dallas much.
Yeah,
but there sure are a lot of people that work down there.
Is the crime rate still bad?
Definitely.
And I went down there a couple, maybe three weeks ago for a trial,
and, I mean, all these people were standing up, that was, you know, during the workday all along the streets, you know, just all around these vacant buildings, just a lot of vacant buildings,
Huh.
and they're just being demolished,
Huh.
and, and they stink
Yeah.
Huh, that's terrible.
Uh-huh.
So, Garland, how nice is it now,
it's been a while since I've been there.
You know, I think it might be up to two hundred and fifty thousand.
It's gotten big.
Yes,
it has.
I think when we moved here it was like a hundred and twenty, something like that.
And I didn't realize, when I moved here, that it was a separate town from Dallas
Well, yeah,
it is.
I know, now
but I didn't.
Where you from?
I'm from Kilgore, Texas
it's in east,
Kilgore,
I know where Kilgore is.
Oh, where you from?
I'm, I'm originally from Lubbock.
Are you?
Yeah.
So, why did you move up to Colorado?
Seemed like the thing to do at the time.
Well, it's real pretty up there.
I have a friend, in Denver.
Oh, I love it, the mountains.
I love the mountains,
What do you,
uh, back to the topic,
What?
it seems that, uh, more and more people are not owning traditional homes these days.
They're not owning homes, period.
Yeah,
yeah,
uh, everyone says, you know,
when I bought this several years ago when our local economy was good everyone said, no, no, you're crazy to buy a mobile home.
Uh-huh.
But now it seems that, uh, with the local economy bad and T I
and strange it seems that, uh,
It wasn't such a bad idea?
Oh, they're doing some back pedaling.
So, have you got, uh, land?
No,
I'm renting at the time,
so.
I did that one year,
I lived with two other girls
and we all taught.
And it was a two bedroom,
so, we took turns, you know, having, sharing the bedroom.
Gosh.
Yeah.
I got to where I decided I wanted to pay more rent and get a private bedroom.
And then we had two baths
it was just, one, the little bathroom, were the thing that really bothered me because I felt real closed in.
Well, mobile homes have changed a lot probably since you had one.
That was in the seventies.
Ours is wood ours is wood sided,
Uh-huh.
and it has a traditional V top , roof,
I'm sorry.
and, uh, it's nine hundred and eighty square foot.
What, two bedroom, one bath, rooms are nice sized.
Uh-huh.
Well, you can imagine nine hundred eighty square foot broke up into two bedrooms, one bath,
So have, Have you got it under ?
it's, it's comfy.
Yes.
Are you required to by law?
We were down here.
It was already setup when we bought it.
Yeah,
well, I bet it's not bad.
Oh, yeah,
it's wood sided it has sheetrock everywhere,
and, uh, you know, so, it's quieter than you remember mobile homes to be.
Okay,
but how much is yours?
When we bought ours we were paying uh, three hundred twenty-nine dollars.
Oh, our payments are like two twenty.
For how many years?
Fifteen.
Oh, so, it was still a lot cheaper,
And, uh, what?
so, it was still a lot cheaper than what we gave because ours is thirty years,
and we bought one of the cheapest houses, you know, a tract house.
Yeah,
oh, yes.
A mobile home's a heck of a lot cheaper,
Which probably didn't make much difference.
it did.
have a in it.
No,
no,
no
what I meant, not in quality,
what I meant was, four years equity costs five hundred dollars.
In the price.
Gee, nice, huh.
That sounds good.
So, you know, there's not that much time left on the loan
and,
So, if the economy gets better, are you going to get another one, another house?
I, don't know.
No?
Uh, to tell you the truth right now it feels kind of comfy to have our mobile home and have it so close to paid for.
You know, it's like me to pickup and move somewhere else, somewhere else is easy.
But you wouldn't take that mobile home,
right?
Sure.
You would?
Sure,
absolutely.
It would be cheaper to move that than buy another one.
Oh, absolutely.
When I, you know, when you talk about the deal like I got, yeah, yeah, it would be cheaper.
Uh, especially if it were a paid move or something.
You know, there's some paid moves occasionally.
T I would pay to move you?
I don't know
but they did,
when I, when I moved up here,
so, they might want to move away.
So, how many years you been up there?
Uh, six or seven.
Do you snow ski?
Uh, a little bit, little bit,
mostly I just love walking in the mountains, driving in the mountains.
It's real pretty.
I went rock climbing one time.
Oh, that's exciting.
my friend talked me in that
I'm a real, um, scaredy when it comes to heights
but once we got on top of the rocks it was quite,

You want to go first
Well, uh, no
I I don't get as much exercise as I, as I should as, or as I would like to, uh, uh, these days.
I,
seems to be to easy to get busy with other things.
Uh, I have, in the past, uh, jogged and, and run,
and every, every January and every September, I start out again
and then it tapers off
Really?
Uh, what about you?
Well, yeah,
I do a lot of exercise.
Right now, I'm into jazzercise, which I absolutely love.
Uh, I started about two years ago because I gained some weight over the past few years
and I wanted to get it back off
Uh-huh.
and I was going through a divorce
and I just found that running really made me feel good.
Yeah.
Got out a  lot of aggression.
I went to the gym every day
and I ran on the treadmill and rode the bike
and, uh, I felt really good.
I needed to do it
and it was really helpful at the time.
Now when I do those things, they're boring.
I would rather be outside then in the gym doing this in one place.
Uh-huh.
And so I just recently discovered jazzercise, about two months ago.
And I'm getting to be a good dancer from it
and I'm just feeling really good.
I love the class,
it's real challenging,
so I'm really into that,
I really like that a lot.
Well now that, is that, uh, that's related to the, the aerobic, uh,  ,
It is, it's  aerobics
but it's with dance steps.
Okay.
It's an aerobic exercise
and it's an hour straight.
And it's just, uh, it's a lot of fun.
Yeah,
yeah.
and I'm, I'm getting much better.
My stamina is getting great for the dance floor
so  I mean it's just,
Yeah.
there's a lot of positive things with it,
so.
Well, uh, okay.
Now that's inside again,
right?
It is inside
and  I've  been doing a lot of bike riding outside with the nice weather we've been having
But,
and I just enjoy that much more too  than inside.
Do, do you  like to do it with other people.
I mean like the, the  jazzercise would be?
I have a  thirteen year old daughter
and so we go bike riding
and it's nice.
We get to spend some time together rather than I go to the gym while she does her homework.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So I've enjoyed that part of it.
Yeah.
And at the gym, even in the class, uh, I,
it's not really a group where you chat a lot.
Everybody's on their way to someplace
Right.
and so, you know,  I do  have one friend who goes occasionally
But,
but, basically, I do it by myself in a group of maybe forty
so.
Yeah,
right.
Right.
But still there are, there are other people there doing the,  doing the same thing.
There are, there are.
It's more motivating  that way, I think.
Yeah.
In terms of motivation and incentive,
yeah.
You could get a tape probably and do it at home in front of the T V
but
you probably wouldn't.
Yeah.
So.
Yeah,
uh, that makes a difference doesn't it?
Yeah.
I, I've,
one thing,
when, when I have run and jogged, uh,
I've always enjoyed doing it by myself
and, and,
not with the sense that it was, uh, uh, chore or something that I was having to do,
I, I've really enjoyed just the activity
and, uh, I write software, uh, as far as the job
and so getting out and being active, uh, is, uh, uh, helps out.
The,
it's
Yeah,
yeah,
I can see it'll be a good break.
The the the  change of pace and  just  getting out and around
Right.
and I find that I can often, you know,
often, uh, when I get around to doing it, then I, I feel better when I get back to  work
Uh-huh
and, uh, uh, also that, that, it, my subconscious is working on things while  I'm working
and I, I go back
and I've got new ideas,
but  still .
I think  you do.
You feel very good after you exercise.
I think  it's worth making the time for yourself.
Yeah.
You owe it to yourself
Yeah.
and I think you do accomplish more after that.
Yeah.
And I think that it's just is good for your self-esteem, for everything because when you look better, you feel better
and it's just, uh,
I think it's well worth it.
I just demand that time for myself.
Now I've learned to do that
Yeah.
and, you know, and it's, I think it just benefits you all around.
So.
Yeah,
I think that's, uh, I think that's a good term, demanding the time for yourself.
That  you've just got to   you've just got to
You have to.
Because   there's always more things  to do.
Right.
There is  always things that you can make priority to it
but I just, I don't demand a lot for myself
and so you know, I just feel entitled to it
Yeah.
and I take it
so.
Well good,
well good.
Well, uh, uh, have you, have you done any jogging?
I tell you, you said you did on the bike and on the treadmill in, in the,  uh, club.
No,
I've  done some walking with friends in the past.
Uh-huh.
But I find that when you do that, you do more chatting than you do exercise
Yeah.
and that's not really beneficial,
so, uh I don't have time like that
Yeah,
yeah.
and I spend enough time chatting around  everywhere, you know

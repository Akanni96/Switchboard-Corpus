So what movies have you seen?
Uh, well, I have, uh, seen DANCES WITH WOLVES, which is probably the, the best movie that I have seen lately.
Uh, I do not go out to films very often. So, as far as out of the house.
Uh-huh.
So we do get a lot of videos that we bring in,
uh, and I see some that way.
But, uh, I am not real current on films.
How about you?
Yeah.
I saw DANCES WITH WOLVES and, uh, HOME ALONE
and,
I hear that is really good, but I have not seen it yet.
Yeah.
It is.
Yeah
It is about a little kid that, that his parents go off to Paris.
Uh-huh.
And they, they forget all about him.
The oldest daughter, they take a head count and the oldest daughter counts one of the neighbor kids instead of,
Oh, cute.
And he is up in the attic asleep because he got in trouble.
Oh, dear.
So she made him go sleep upstairs.
Uh-huh.
And there is, there is a couple of burglars, uh, breaking into the houses in the neighborhood.
Oh,
And, uh,
Oh, and he hears them or something
and,
Yeah.
And he sets up traps for them all over the house.
Who wins?
Uh, he does.
Oh, great,
great.
Yeah,
I had heard people talk about it,
and they say it was really cute, but I had not seen it.
Uh-huh.
Uh, we usually wait
and eventually it comes out on video,
and then we get it and see it that way.
Right.
And that is, it,
movies are very expensive.
Uh, movie theatres here, they are six dollars, uh, for evening performances.
And that is kind of steep,
Uh-huh.
I think.
I don't know.
How much is it in Dallas?
Well, it is six dollars,
and then but you get, um, matinee prices.
But,
Yeah.
You can do that, but it is difficult if you, if you work or, you know,
Uh-huh.
uh, that is taking the middle of the afternoon.
And if I am looking for entertainment usually I, I, have more, uh, time in the evening than I do in the middle of the day to, uh, see things.
What do you think of movies in general?
As far as the, as the trends?
Well, I think they are a lot better than they than they were,
well, like, um, in the early eighties or the, during the, like the SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT era.
Uh-huh.
When it was,
they,
I do not think they were very good during that time.
Yeah.
At least there were not as many good ones.
Did,
Yeah.
The quality I think maybe has improved in that respect.
Uh-huh.
Uh, the only thing that disturbs me is that now they think they have to add just a little bit of sex and violence in order to get a, a tougher rating. Which suggests that, that, you know, it will be more enticing to the, to the public.
And a lot of times it is added for no real, uh, valid reason.
Uh-huh.
Uh, which does not make,
and I think SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT was a little bit like that.
Yeah.
Uh, but DANCES WITH WOLVES did not seem to have anything added.
It was just all legitimate kind of, uh, film.
And that is where reason why I suppose it won so many Oscars, uh,
because it really was good even though it is such a long movie.
You know, they said, "Oh, people won't, won't be interested in a three hour movie." But it certainly gotten good acclaim everywhere it has gone.
And it was shocking at the end too.
So,
Oh, oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Absolutely.
Uh, but much more true to life
and I think that is, that is the point.
Yeah.
That is right.
Uh, they do not have to keep making up stuff if they want to make something good.
Uh-huh.
I hate sequels too.
I hate these, uh, you know, number one, two, three, four.
Uh-huh.
Usually if a movie is good, once is enough
Yeah.
Especially JAWS.
Right.
That was on Prime Time Television here, uh, recently at seven thirty in the evening.
And, uh, it was kind of shocking because that is a scary movie. And children, young children could see, could have seen that movie, uh, at that hour.
Uh-huh.
And I thought, that, you know, that would not have been the sort of thing I would have wanted my children to see at that age, uh, I mean when they were young.
And here it was quite easily seen by anybody that turned on the T V.
Right.
Uh, which was a,
it was a good movie.
I mean it was well done but, uh, that is one reason why it was scary.
Uh-huh.
So, but I do not know that I have seen any of the, uh, sequels to that.
I think one is enough.
Yeah.
Uh,
Just more of the same.
That is what people say.
In one of them they have a mother shark, uh, destroy a whole, uh, marina and aquarium. Which is kind of far fetched.
Oh.
Yeah.
It,
just a touch.
Yeah.
Well, the whole movie is kind of far fetched.
Uh-huh.
But, I mean the whole idea behind it is far fetched.
They hardly ever play music when a shark attacks somebody.
Not, not too often
Yeah.
That has gotten to be a whole camp idea now though, you know.
If you hear that music, you know, everybody knows what you are talking about.
Yeah.
It's funny.
Well, it sounds like neither one of us are real movie buffs.
Well, uh, every once in a while, I go, but it, it has to be like somebody that I like
or,
Yeah.
you know. I did not, I did not go see FIELD OF DREAMS when it was in the theatre because I did not know it was any good.
Uh-huh.
And then when it was, I, I found out it was Kevin Costner when it was on, um, I guess A B C the other week,
then I,
Right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And then I really liked it.
It was good.
Uh-huh.
It was very good.
But, uh, um, uh, see I have, uh, teenagers in my house.
And of course sometimes they rent movies and, you know, have friends over or something.
And sometimes movies are here that I did not, I am not even aware that I could have seen, you know.
Because my family tells me that, that, that it had been actually in the house before
Huh.
But I had missed it.
But I did see it on T V,
and I thought it was good.
Yeah.
It was really,
and then, and then, uh, Shoeless Joe Jackson really was a player.
I thought they made him up, and then I found out, you know, after I saw the movie that, they, they started talking about that scandal
and,
Oh, really?
Yeah,
when the, when the anniversary came up
Uh-huh.
that was around the time of anniversary, you know.
No kidding.
And then it was on the news.
Oh, I did not realize that.
Yeah.
Uh, you know, the character that, uh, James Earle Jones played?
Uh-huh.
Uh, uh, I teach in school,
and we are doing a book called INVISIBLE MAN by Ralph Ellison.
Uh-huh.
And I wondered if maybe he was patterned after him.
Yeah.
Uh, I do not know,
I had not heard anybody talk about it.
But, uh, he certainly could have been. Uh, which was kind of interesting. You know, someone who, uh, who was a real activist but then took up the cause. Uh, kind of gave up, you know, because he did not think anything was happening,
Yeah.
and so, uh, it was kind of fun.
Yeah.
And I wondered who it was too.
I do not know for sure,
but there are certain, uh, qualities that suggest it could be he.
Because they were, uh, they were suggesting that this Ben was something of a recluse.
That he had stopped writing and had stopped, you know,
and that is true for Ellison.
He, he wrote that one book and a few essays and that is about it. And, uh, has pretty much dropped out of public life.
Huh.
But he is still alive
and that, you know, that is what makes it so interesting.
Uh-huh.
And that book, have you ever read that book? INVISIBLE MAN.
Uh, I
What is that?
INVISIBLE MAN?
INVISIBLE MAN by Ralph Ellison.
Uh, no.
Huh-uh.
It is an incredible book.
It, uh, really is very, very interesting.
I highly recommend it.
Uh, did they make the movies after that
or,
Uh, the,
yeah,
the movie,
the
in
FIELD, FIELD OF DREAMS came out after, uh, that novel.
Uh-huh.
So it could easily have been patterned after him.
But the, the movie did not have anything to do with, with the story that I am talking about.
But
Right.
I just thought the the, uh, author could have been patterned after that, uh,
I mean that character could have been patterned after him or someone like him, certainly.
Uh-huh.
Sort of interesting,
so. Well, I guess we have talked probably our time limit, haven't we?
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
It was Nice talking to you.
Very good.
It was nice talking to you.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.

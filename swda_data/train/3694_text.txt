Okay
Yes.
First off, speaking of air pollution I'm coughing .
Um, I'm not sure what contributes to air pollution exactly.
I find it hard to believe that a lot of the hair sprays and things that we use cause the air pollution.
Yeah,
it, it.
It doesn't seem like,
but I guess when you think of it everybody has some sort of aerosol in their home you know,
Yeah.
and it's kind of dangerous.
Yeah,
that's true.
Uh-huh.
Uh, I don't know.
We live, um, well, I'm close to Salt Lake
Uh-huh.
and there's mountains, uh, you know, all around.
But sometimes I think tend to hold a little bit of it in, you know.
Oh, yeah.
Really, it's, it's fairly clean, um,
I think it's a fairly clean city compared to some,
but, you know how quite a,
But you think the mountains and the, are kind of a barrier?
Yeah
Oh .
I think sometimes it seems to be
but, But, uh, anyway, I don't know.
That's an interesting thought.
I know there's a lot of plants here,
when I drive down you know, along the, just along the freeway, there's a lot of plants that they're burning things
Uh-huh.
and,
Here in Texas I know a lot of the, pretty much every place here is relatively flat,
and so I would think that that would probably contribute to us not having that big of a, like a smog problem or something like that.
Oh, uh-huh.
Yeah.
We, we have a real fog problem. Um.
Um.
The last few years just in, through December and January it, it really is foggy and, and seems to just, um,
it's kind of like it, it just stays for a month quite foggy.
Uh-huh.
But, uh, gee,
I don't, I don't know what else.
I
I know cars
I
yeah,
I guess I've never really, uh, thought about the fact, like in California they, they have a lot of smog problems.
Uh-huh.
And it's real hilly there.
Yeah.
So that is probably something that plays a big factor.
I think probably just, uh, a lot of factories, um, you know, they have the smoke stacks, I guess you call them and different things like that.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
that's, that's what I see burning a lot.
I'm not exactly sure what they're burning.
I know, uh-huh, there are some oil companies,
and I'm sure that that contributes a lot
Uh-huh.
just the burning of the
Aren't they supposed to be coming out with some sort of, uh, special gas or something that doesn't emit certain chemicals or something?
Oh, I don't know.
I haven't, I haven't heard that.
Um.
I know, uh,
I don't know how your emissions test is on your cars or anything,
but I know I think they, they differ from state to state.
Oh, okay.
But, um, you know, that's been a new thing in the last few years,
Uh-huh.
and I guess some cars are a lot worse than others.
I think those, uh,
what are they,
the,
I know,
a Rabbit's one, diesel
Uh-huh,
the diesel.
the diesel cars.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah,
they seem to put out quite a bit
I know a lot of people with diesels
Huh.
truck, you know.
Oh.
But, um.
Well, do you, um, are you working for T I?
No,
I don't.
Oh, okay.
I, I work in Waco at a T V station.
Oh.
My mother works at T I.
Oh, uh-huh.
That's why,
And that's how you got involved.
Yeah,
yeah.
Yeah.
You work at T I?
No
Oh, okay.
we, we have, um,
my husband's sister lives in Dallas actually.
Okay.
And they kind of got it, us involved that way.
Oh, okay.
Yeah
That's interesting.
but. Well, I don't, I don't know.
What else causes air pollution? Um,
Noise.
Yeah,
noise.
Noise causes air pollution
I've got,
speaking of noise, you can probably hear my little.
Yeah,
that's why I thought of it.
Yeah,
he is quite noisy.
Yes,
gee,
I don't know.
I know that, um,
don't dumps, you know, where you dump all your trash in the, uh.
Oh.
Yeah.
Landfills.
Yeah,
I'm sure that does.
I know they're always churning that up
We just.
and I, I think they burn a lot there, too.
Yeah.
We just had a big, uh, thing here in Waco.
They're needing to open a new landfill, or to expand onto the old landfill.
And, uh, it's, it's really been a big fight because a lot of the people that live by the landfill don't want it expanded, because they're thinking that they're water is going to be contaminated somehow.
Oh.
And so they,
Well, I don't think I'd, I'd like that.
You know, we, um
Yeah.
when we've taken things to the dump, just the dump, uh, that is, uh, you know, closest to us,
there's some houses around there,
Uh-huh.
and I know that on windy days, you know they're always moving the, the trash over to different spots,
Oh, yeah.
and they've got those big bulldozers,
and you can see the dust flying,
Uh-huh.
and, and I'm sure that their homes are really quite  dusty
One  one of the big concerns is they have a, there's a school right across the highway from the landfill.
and,
Oh, is there.
Yeah.
So the parents were really, really upset.
Worried about their their kids getting, huh.
Yeah.
They, they've been fighting over it for the last year,
and they just now approved it.
So they're going to try an appeal or something.

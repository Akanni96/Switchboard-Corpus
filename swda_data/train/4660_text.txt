Okay.
How do you get your news mostly?
Generally, I get most of my news from, uh, the radio.
And then sometimes, uh, if I've got time, I'll be reading the front page of the newspaper  and  just fall off on the articles that I like.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh, also, since my wife likes to watch T V, sometimes, uh, having just being there I get, uh, you know, I have to watch the news late at night with T V.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
How about you?
Well, I can hardly wait for my morning paper to come.
Uh-huh
So that's the first thing I want is the headlines.
It's really funny because because, uh, uh, my sister grabs the sports and I grab the headlines
Uh-huh.
But, uh, and then when five o'clock comes around I just want to get in the house and turn the T V on to watch the news.
Um.
It's really weird.
Uh, I don't stay up late to watch late news because my eyes won't stay up that long.
But, uh, I love to watch the five o'clock news
and I, makes me angry when my paper boy's not there on time where I can read my paper
Um.
Uh, I do have my radio going most of the day though,
so about every hour it breaks in and gives me news too, you know.
Okay.
Do you  get like one of the talk stations, the news stations?
But,
No.
Uh-huh. *listen; mistranscribed 'uh-uh'
I just have a channel that has music except for, like every hour, you know, say eight o'clock,  nine  o'clock, they come on for just a little bit of the news.
Sure.
Right.
But as far as the actual news, I get that from like a call from the,
can you hold on just for a second?
Sure.
Just a minute.
answers the other Hello sir comes back to speaker
Yes.
Yes,
I'm sorry to keep you waiting
Okay
Uh, I was calling from work
so and that was a call waiting.
Right.
it sounds like you, uh, like the news a lot more than I do.
Me, I figure if it's something really important, somebody will tell me about it.
But, uh, you know, I, the thing is if, if I catch the news all the time, it just makes me depressed because they tend to produce a lot of bad news.
Or that's what  comes on first.
Yeah,
That's true too.
And, uh, you know, also late at night, you know, I don't like watching the news late at night
but my wife is usually up then
and so  I can't go to sleep with the T V on.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
I, uh,
but, you know, I, I wish I had, uh, more news on things like, that I consider long range. Things like science and medicine
Uh-huh.
uh, I'm more, I guess I'm more into science and science fiction
and, uh, there's, you know,
not that the news is science fiction,
but, uh, uh, I'm more interested in that.
Things like, uh, is NASA ready for another space shot. Uh, you know, how hot are they on the trail of a cure for such and such cancer
Uh-huh.
and, uh, uh, you know, a lot of the news isn't that interesting to me.
Yeah.
Well, you're right.
There is a lot of it that's, that's just garbage, as far as I'm concerned, you know.
Uh-huh.
But I just like the, more or less, the, the daily news, you know. Just, uh, especially the weather.
Yeah.
I like that
Me, too.
Although they're usually wrong
Yeah,
Georgia here, they're usually wrong too.
We have weird weather systems.
Uh-huh.
But, uh, like I say, as far as, as actually listening to the news, it's mostly T V, five o'clock to six thirty.
Uh, that seems like a long time for news
but that's how long it is.
Yeah.
And, uh, seems like they have the local news and they have the world news.
Uh-huh.
And then, uh, my morning paper. I can hardly wait for it to come.
Yeah.
I'm  you know, I, I just, uh, I would,
And, uh,
I, I, I'm not a morning person
so I would begrudge the time it takes me in the morning to catch my  morning news.
I get up just barely in time to get up, get ready and get off to work
and then  at work  I have no time to read the news.
Oh.
Yeah,
right.
Once you get to work, I wouldn't either,
huh-uh.
No
But I've always been a morning person to get up, you know.
Uh-huh.
but I can't stay up late at night to watch the late news
so I guess that's why I watch it at five o'clock
Yeah.
But anyhow. Well, listen, I guess that's about it then.
Okay.
It's been nice talking to you Tony.
Nice talking to you.
I'll probably talk to you again.
I had a friend who was in this
and he said that he got calls from the same caller sometimes.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
Oh, well that hasn't happened to me yet.
So, you never know,
it might this time.
That's right.
Okay, Tony.
Take it easy.
Uh-huh.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye

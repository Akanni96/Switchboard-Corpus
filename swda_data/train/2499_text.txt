Okay.
like a All right.
What have you seen?
The latest movie I've seen that I thought was fantastic was DANCES WITH  WOLVES.
That's,
I knew you were going to say that.
I wanted, I want  to go see that.
Oh, man.
like water I, I just finally ended up going to see it, uh,
and one day my husband had the kids
and I just went because we couldn't, we could never get to go see it together because it's so long.
By the time we had a babysitter for that  long.
Gosh.
So I finally just went to see it.
And I just thought it was fantastic.
Yeah.
I, I, I watched, uh, Costner on the Academy Awards.
I was really happy that he got,
I was hoping he was going to get Best Actor.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Uh,  but he, he, he did pretty good on that one.
That was quite a, like ping
the buffalo scene in that  thing  was so real.
Yeah.
It's like,
I mean it just  blew me away.
Yeah,
I'd, I bet.
Yeah.
There're several of them that are out right now that I want to see.
Uh,  DANCES. Uh, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.
Yeah.
Uh, I'm, I'm afraid to go see that one.
That one looks so scary  just,  from the previews.
I thought gosh  I'd probably have nightmares for the next six months
Nay.
It's supposed to  be good though.
Nay.
That's what people said,
I know some friends who went to see it.
Yeah.
They said it was really riveting.
Yeah.
Well, you know, they, they, that's what they said about THE EXORCIST, you know.
No, no,
it's terrible.
You'll have nightmares, you know.
I watched last weekend.
Me and my roommate.
We, we laughed about it
Well, you're not a thirteen year old.
I  don't know.
I saw it when I was a kid
and I thought, oh, man
Well, I'll tell,
well I guess, I, I guess it was because I'd read the book before I saw the movie.
Oh, uh-huh.
And the book, to me, was far more frightening than the movie was.
Oh, really.
Huh. Gosh.
Yeah.
He's  a very good writer
and he had a way of putting you in that scene, you know.
It was,
Oh, boy.
Yeah.
And, of course, I was, I was living alone at the time
and it was late at night and  scary and, you know
You start hearing noises  you know.
Gosh.
Call the crisis line.
Yeah,
I bet.
And there's rats in the attic, you know.
Oh, gosh.
Uh, let's see.
There was a couple of others that are out,
and I can't  remember,
I saw one  I thought was crummy.
With that new, uh, Michael J Fox movie, THE HARD WAY.
Where he plays a, a actor  that's, uh, like huh.
Yeah.
I, I didn't,  I didn't even like the previews on that.
Oh, I know.
It was,
well I ended up at the theater
and there was, didn't seem to be anything else on  I wanted to see,
so I'll try that.
But it wasn't worth anything.
I didn't care  for that at all.
No.
I, I don't much care for Michael J Fox anyway.
Yeah.
Well, the last two I saw him in, one of those BACK TO THE FUTURE, PART THREE deals
and that was crummy  also.
I  didn't think that was any good
Yeah.
so
I saw the original  BACK TO THE FUTURE
and then I, I know,
I hardly ever go see a sequel.
Yeah.
I mean, I think, I think the only I've ever seen a sequel was TWO THOUSAND AND ONE.
Oh, boy.
Uh, TWO THOUSAND AND TEN was far better.
Yeah.
Yeah.
TWO THOUSAND AND  ONE was a good movie if you had read the book.
Well, I hadn't read it
and I couldn't figure what was going on  half the time,
so
Yeah.
No,
nobody  could figure it out.
I mean  the, the book was so much, uh,
Yeah.
there's just things,
all you can do is put it in words.
You can't put it in pictures.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You know, a lot  of that stuff that was going on in the film, you say what is this?
You know, what's the significance of the apes, you know
Yeah,
yeah.
I should probably go back and read the book now that  I just saw the movie again not too long ago.
Oh, the book is really good.
I mean, I, I keep a little library of books that I just like to read over and over again
and that's one of them.
Wow. Huh.
It's, it's so well written.
Huh. Well, I have one I bet you haven't seen if you don't have kids. OTIS AND MILO.
Oh, you're right.
I haven't
Oh, that is, that is the most precious movie.
It has, to see it on the big screen because it's just the most gorgeous nature scenes you've ever seen in your life.
And it's all this,
it's the story of this little cat and dog
and it's not like cutesy.
It's just, uh, it's just so realistic. Everything they do.
You wonder how in the world they ever got them to do some of these things.
Huh.  Oh, those
And it was,  A real dog  and  cat
a real dog and cat?
Huh.
and all the other animals.
They initially start out in the barnyard kind of setting where they're raised.
And then the cat gets, um, on this treacherous journey.
He climbs into a box and ends up floating down this river
and he winds up all over creation.
I don't know where in the world it is.
Somewhere in China somewhere I think that it was  filmed.
Huh.
But, uh, it's just  really an incredible thing.
sounds sort of like the incredible journey.
Yeah.
It was pretty wild
and . Of course, the only sound is Dudley Moore narrates it.
Uh-huh.
But there's no, you know, nothing else to keep it going.
But it really keeps keeps me going.
Huh.
I, I've seen it  twice now
Yeah.
that  sounds a lot like a Walt Disney film.
Huh?
Sounds a lot a like a Walt Disney film.
Yeah.
It was like the best of the Walt Disney ones.
Walt Disney's kind of gotten worse  in my opinion over the past few years.
Oh, yeah.
Not anymore.
I mean,  I, I, I was raised on Walt Disney films. You know.
Yeah.
OLD YELLER. Uh,  BIG RED.
Yeah.
All those  old good ones that you, you know, wish they  had on  more now,
Yeah.
but.
When I was a little kid, I saw the INCREDIBLE JOURNEY on Christmas Eve
and  it was so good that I had  forgotten  that it was Christmas Eve.
Oh, boy.
Huh.
I mean  that's something for a kid.
That's pretty good.
Really.
And that was something for greedy old me at Christmas time,  I'll tell you.
Let's see.
What are some other ones I've seen lately.
I'm trying to remember.
I can't.
Oh, I just saw one on the video.
Oh, um, have you seen THE GODS MUST BE CRAZY, PART TWO?
No
That is a riot.
Is it?
Yeah.
The first one was really good.
But the second  one  is really good too.
I was really surprised.
Yeah.
I didn't much care  for the first one.
Maybe that's,
No,
I thought it was funny.
But, that's my sense of humor
Well, I, I'll have to go get that one I guess.
It's hard to find movies that aren't terrible violent or terribly bunch of sex going on anymore.
And I'm just, I guess I'm just middle America or something.
I just go to be entertained
and  and not really  interested in some of the, like the TERMINATOR or some of the  Schwarzenegger stuff.
Yeah.  Yeah. *b
I just.
I get so tired  of, you know, these, you know, sequels.
Number nine, number ten,  number  fourteen.
Yeah.
FREDDY'S REVENGE PART TWENTY-FIVE or whatever.
Yeah, you know.
Yeah, you know.
Yeah.
I've never,
FREDDY  EATS A NUCLEAR WARHEAD, you know.
I, I'm just,
I'm so sick and tired of that.
I just can't believe it.
It's like  ROCKY films.
I  I haven't seen a one.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I've never seen any of those.
I can't stand Stallone.
Yeah.
I can't either.
He seems so macho I just
Yeah.
And I, I was afraid that RAMBO was going to do the same thing that ROCKY was going to do, you know.  Go into  fourteen hundred episodes.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Now I don't, I hardly ever watch T V.
If I ever get the hankering to see something, I've got, I don't know, maybe about thirty or forty movies
and I just,
Yeah.
When they're so cheap too at the video stores that you can.
Yeah.
I don't even rent them. You know.
You don't?
I, I figure if I find a movie I like, I'll buy it.
Cause I just watch them over and over again.
That's like,
my husband does that.
He can  watch  them over and over.
Yeah.
I,
And I'm,
there's very few I would want to see that many times.
So he, he, once he has one he likes,  he likes to watch it over and over.
Yeah.
My, my very favorite one  that the top of the tick for me is, uh, EXCALIBUR.
Oh, yeah.
That was a good one.
I haven't seen that one in a long time.
I, I loved that film. Um,
it's just so well done.
Yeah.
And  I lived over in England for four years,
Oh, boy.
That was the first place I ever saw it.
Uh-huh.
And it was just, gosh,
it was so good.
Oh, gosh.
It was, it was filmed in Ireland.
Huh.
And they got pretty scenery in Ireland.
Yeah,
I bet
Yeah,
it's nice.
Gosh.
And I, I've been down to the south of England where supposedly King Arthur's castle was.
Oh, boy.
So, that really has a lot of meaning for you to see that.
Yeah,
it was, yeah it was unimpressive to look at.
I mean, the whole thing was about the size of a, a medium house
Yeah.
It wasn't,
Oh, really
Well, when I was in England years ago.
And I went to, to like Shakespeare's and, you know,  Stratford-On-Avon  and all that
Oh, yeah.
and it was like you couldn't stand up inside of it
because it  was so  short.
Yeah.
The  ceilings  were so short.
Yeah.
But Yeah.
Yeah.
There's some nice stuff over there to see.
Yeah.
I, I spent four years traveling around and didn't see, you know, hardly anything.
I just,
Oh, boy.
I need, to go over there and stay about twenty years so I can just travel.  Go around all the places.
Yeah.
Stonehenge, of course, you know.
Every, everybody makes the obligatory trip to Stonehenge.
Yeah,
yeah.
Okay,
big deal.
Here's some rocks sitting out in the middle  of a field.
Okay
It's boring.
Did you see any movies over there
I remember I went to see DON QUIXOTE over there when it came out.
It came out right around the time, with Sophia Loren
and that was a riot to  see that.
You know something,
I, come to think of it, I don't think I went to the movies one time.
Yeah.
Cause when you're touristing, you probably don't want to take the time to go see a movie.
I, uh,
where I lived. Uh, it was a little town called Newmarket. About seventy miles north of London.
Huh.
Oh, boy
And there was another town called Barry Saint Edmunds about twenty miles away from us.
Uh-huh.
And they had a little, uh, theater company there
and we use to go, go out to that about once a week.
Oh, boy.
Yeah.
A really nice place.
You know, amateurs but really quite good.
Yeah.
Uh, but that was interesting.
Course  go to London quite a lot and see shows down there.
That  sounds great.
Yeah.
Uh, but other than that I just didn't have time to go to the movies,  you know.
Yeah.
Never any, anyway, anything that I ever wanted,
I rented a lot of videos
Uh-huh
Cause the closest movie theater was Barry Saint Edmunds
and who wants  who wants to drive twenty miles to go to the movies
Oh, boy.
Probably some of them did
A lot of, a lot of people did.
Yeah.
But it would have to be a good show.
Yeah.
It's hard to know what the good movies are anymore.
Yeah.
Because sometimes the reviews you just can't go  by.
Yeah.
I, I
they, they, they have all these neat phrases. You know, you know, you know. Like critically acclaimed.
Yeah.
That's what they when the thing hasn't won any award. *listen
Oh, I see
You know.  They can't,
It's kind  of like waterfront property or something  if you're,  you know, if you're two miles away from water
Yeah,
yeah.
Yeah,
from Love Canal
Water view
Waterfront property here at Love Canal, you know.
Yeah.
But, you know, critically acclaimed.
Oh, good grief.
Give me a break.
That's
I mean, there's a lot of reasons why I don't go to movies.
Uh-huh.
And primarily, I mean, I, now I'm probably going to, going to upset you.
But people who bring kids  irritates the heck out of me

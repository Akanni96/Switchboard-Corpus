Hi,
my name is Donna,
and I'm calling, calling from Plano, Texas.
I'm Jay in Dallas.
Oh, okay, um,
I, um, find exercise kind of a task, I guess I'd say.
I go to aerobics two days a week,
but I also have three kids at home
so they keep me pretty busy.
That keeps you plenty of exercise .
Yeah,
that gives me plenty of exercise,
but I enjoy, um, walking outside and bicycling once in a while with the family.
Excuse me sound as if hand over the
That's fine.
And yourself.
Well, I, uh, I have,
I walked and run um, almost every morning.
I've sort of stopped here with the weather change,
but, uh, it's about a thirty minute exercise every morning.
Uh-huh,
every morning.
Well, my husband swims every day at lunch, which he loves doing
Oh, that would,
that's fantastic exercise.
yeah,
he does it every day like a ritual.
Once in a while or if he has a business meeting or if he, um, someone invites him to lunch, he'll, he'll not go,
but he goes, um, every, every day,
and then he he's a runner, too.
He runs three mornings a week
he gets up about five and, and does his, his deal,
Um.
and some days he doesn't,
but then maybe he'll catch up on the weekend and go for a run.
All right.
And, um, we .
I'd rather get a bicycle,
but I have an I had an exercise bike in the house, but didn't seem to use it enough,
so somebody sold it in a garage sale,
and so, uh but I'd like to get a bike and just do, uh, do biking outside.
Oh.
The, the, the bicycling is nice especially with the weather around here,
and I know, um, uh, we, we both of, my husband and I both do it to just keep the pounds off.
We're getting up in age, I guess, in our late thirties
so we need to keep exercising just to be able to, uh.
Yeah.
It keeps going,
because I'm fifty-five,
and it, uh, it just gets worse.
You still want to eat,
and, uh but you just,
Oh, I know.
I think you feel better, too, if you get on some program like that,
but, uh.
Yeah,
I go to this aerobics class two mornings a week,
and I take my three year old with me.
There's a nursery there.
And it's kind of another day out for her to, um, have little friends,
Uh-huh.
and, um, I, I enjoy the socialization of it, you know,
getting to see the same women every morning,
Right.
but um, there are some parts during that exercise that I think, I cannot do another second of this.
Oh.
I know it, it, it, some of it is so tough
It is.
and, uh, especially when somebody's, uh, planning lunch for you and they know what, what's good for you,
I think when we do it ourselves,
we take the easy way sometimes.
That's true,
that's true.
So.
Well.
So anyway
Okay, well.
thank you for calling.
Yes,
thank you for participating.
All right.
Thank you.
Bye.
Bye-bye.

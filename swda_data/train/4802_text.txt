Okay.
Uh, read any good books lately?
Uh, yes,
I, I've read, uh, several good books lately.
Uh, lot of them related to, uh, business and financial matters since that's what I do for a living.
Oh, okay.
Uh-huh.
How about yourself?
Uh, well I'm in graduate school
and so I read a lot of books
but I don't know if I consider very many of them good
Uh, I haven't read a book for enjoyment since, I guess, around Christmas.
Uh, I received, uh, uh, several books for Christmas
and at Christmas break I read, uh, SARUM by, uh, uh, a fellow named Rutherford.
Yes.
Uh, it's the history of, uh,
well it's sort of the the historical fiction about, uh, the Salisbury area in, in England.
Uh-huh.
And so, I, I really enjoyed that book a lot.
Uh, he's not quite as good as, you know, Michener or some of, uh, some of the other historical writers.
But he, he did this job well,
so.
Well, that sounds good.
Yeah.
Uh, do you find do you find you have much chance to read for, for just pleasure or mostly for business?
No,
I read for pleasure some also.
I read a book recently called IRON JOHN.
Uh-huh.
Have you seen that by Bly?
I don't think I have seen it.
Okay.
Well it's a book about, uh, uh, Greek gods and, and Greek, uh, mythology as well as, uh, man and interacting with other men and a book about, uh, men and how they mature through life.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Oh.
And  how they deal with life itself
Okay.
I think I have heard about that.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
that sounds great.
Did, did it have something to mention about, uh, sort of, uh, cultural rituals of, of manhood?
Yes.
Okay.
Yeah,
I have heard of that.
I have, uh, someone suggested that I read it.
Is it IRON JOHN?
Yes.
Okay.
Good.
By Bly,
B L Y, I believe it is.
B L Y?
Uh-huh.
Okay.
Great.
And, uh, it's a very interesting book.
Uh-huh.
Uh, what are your favorite, uh,
do you have a favorite subject to read, whether it be science fiction or, or history
or,
Well, it depends again if we're talking about uh,
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
And I read a lot of books in the area of, uh, uh, psychology and self-help type, uh, materials.
Okay.
Uh, always trying to understand people better and understand myself in relation to other people and try to understand where the people are coming from because I'm in a people business.
Uh-huh.
Okay.
And, uh, so that, that's,
my work is my hobby
Uh-huh.
That  sounds great
So I, I enjoy it.
Uh, who is your, whose your favorite religious author?
Well, I don't know if I have a favorite uh, religious author.
Uh-huh.
I would have to say that, uh, some of the ones that consistently put out good materials, uh, you know,
that, that's difficult because one person might write one book extremely well and some other ones might not write as well.
Uh-huh.
Uh, I had to stop here and think a second.
One of the ones that I've read recently that I've read several of his books
and I thought that each one of his books were good.
He's the man out of San Antonio.
And, uh,
Max Lucado?
Max Lucado.
Yeah.
Max consistently writes good books.
Yeah.
Uh, he's a great man.
I've met him several times. Uh,
Yes.
I know him,
yeah.
Huh.
But  uh, there's other authors also that have uh, uh, that write good books from time to time, but not consistently put out the materials all the time
Uh, I'd say another, which is a local writer here in Plano, uh, is, uh,
I'm trying to think of his name.
He's with the Bible church.
And that is, uh,
I see his name
but I can't,
I mean I see him
but I can't see his name
But he, uh, he talks about, uh, he talks about a lot of different topics
and,

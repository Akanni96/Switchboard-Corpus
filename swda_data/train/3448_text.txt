Do you have a, do you have any, uh, major preferences as far as television?
T V, uh,
trying to think.
I was trying to think of some while they were calling you. Uh,
I like Friday,

I think it's Friday night.
Uh-huh,

All the, uh, the one with the two little girls in it, what's it called.
Yeah,
uh, oh,
Or three little girls.
Yeah,

Right.
Oh, yeah.
I really like that.
What's it called?
Uh, I don't know,
all I can think of is the name of ALL IN THE FAMILY
but that's not it.
FULL HOUSE.
Yeah,
there you go.
Yeah.
Yeah,
I really like that show.
Yeah,

DONNA REED
Oh, really?
Yeah.
Uh, lately I've been getting into talk shows
and
Oh, yeah?
Yeah,
just, you know, controversy and,
Which which one does, which ones do you like?
Just really whatever.
Uh-huh.
Just as long,
it depends on the subject actually.
Right.
Where, where it's more interesting.
Uh-huh.
Some of them get pretty boring
but,
Yeah.
Yeah,
uh, there's that guy,
I think it's out of Dallas,
his name is, uh, oh,
I wish I could remember his name.
Is he one of the talk show guys?
Yeah,
he's, he's black
Maury Povich?
no,
he's black
and has a bald head
and his first name starts with an M.
Huh, let's see.
Oh, it's like,
his first name's like Marlo or Marlin,
I can't remember his name.
Anyway, he always has like really strange shows like, uh, uh, male strippers or female strippers or just really sensationalistic, you know, like what Geraldo used to be.
Yeah.
Yeah,
see, I don't, I don't like those,
I like more controversial subjects, I think.
I don't either.
Uh-huh.
But, I mean, yeah
Do you watch cartoons a lot?
No.
No.
I'm, I don't watch T V that much, uh, anymore.
It seems like, uh,
I'm going to school right now
so,
Oh, yeah,
where do you go to school?
B Y U.
Oh, really?
Yeah,
so, and I'm working, too,
so everything keeps me pretty busy.
Uh-huh.

But,
I'm going to U T D here in Dallas.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
My dad taught there for a while,
Oh, really?

What did he teach?
Uh, speech pathology.
Oh, that's what I'm majoring in.
I'm a graduate student in speech.
Oh, wow!
Yeah,

No way.
How long have you been there?
Uh, this is my first semester.
Oh, okay,
so you wouldn't know him.
Yeah.
Who, Who, who, who, what, when did he teach?
He, Uh, he taught about a year ago.
He used to work at, uh, uh, University of Texas at

Uh, what are you studying?
Uh, I was, I am studying nursing
but I'm thinking about changing right now
Uh-huh.
I just, I don't know,
and it's really tough to get into the program down here
so if I don't do that, if I decide to stay in nursing I'll probably come and go to T W U.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah,
I'm living in the T W U dorm across from Collier, uh,
Oh, really?
Yeah
and, uh,
My dad used to teach at Collier, too.
Yeah,

I'm living in that dorm
and there, all those nursing majors.
I, I tell you what,
that's, that's a tough, that's a tough, uh, field, though.
Yeah.
Nursing is.
I, I have a lot of respect for those people.
I mean, they've spent a lot of hours studying

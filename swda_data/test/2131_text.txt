What are your music interests?
Uh, just about any kind of music except acid rock
I, I don't care, for acid rock,
Me, too.
Oh.
but, uh, I grew up with country and western,
Yeah,
I did, too,
but, uh,
and then,
just about any kind of music.
I even like classical music.
Yeah,
uh, I'm pretty diversified, too.
I, I don't, I don't like acid rock either.
I, I grew up in a small town
so, uh, the only, we only had one radio station
so it was country music,
Yeah.
but then, uh, when I,
Yeah,
I grew up with Hank Snow, and Lefty Frizzell and Hank Williams and all of those old country and western songs.
Oh, really.
You're older than I am
But, uh, I,
did you happen to see last night the special on Channel Two with James Galway?
We don't get Channel Two.
My, uh, our cable doesn't,
Oh.
I wish we got that what,
but,
That is fabulous.
Was it?
Well, we don't get Channel Two.
We,
Yeah,
when he played DANNY BOY it just almost brought, tears to your eyes, because he can make that flute sing.
Oh, really?
Yeah,
and, uh, it was tremendous.
Now, he, he is a, uh,
actually, I did,
I played flute for, almost ten years
Yeah.
and, and, uh, so, I, I, I appreciate his too, his, his
Yeah.
he, he, he's from Ireland isn't he?
Yeah,
uh-huh,
and it was, uh, mostly all Irish tunes,
Was
yeah.
they had a band with him that, uh, had a harpist and another flute and then a guy that played the bagpipes plus the, uh, tin whistle, and a couple of violins and, uh, drum,
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
and they, they played all the Irish jigs and so forth,
it was just fabulous.
Yeah,
I, he, he is really good.
Yeah,
I, I, I come from a musical background,
Yeah.
so, uh, uh, I've played flute, flute and piano,
so, I, I, I have a big appreciation for music, up to a point.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I, I'm getting now to the age where I don't like the new stuff that's coming and much of the new stuff that's coming out,
Yeah.
Yeah.
my husband says I'm getting old
Yeah
I love, uh, I, I especially like instrumentals.
Do you?
Yeah.
I love to just lay back on the couch and, and turn a good, good instrumental got on and just close my eyes and listen.
Yeah,
that's, that's nice to do, that is.
I've got a, I've got a, I've got a two year old who's now getting,
I'm getting well versed in, in kiddy music
Yeah.
I'm, I've never played an instrument in my life,
I've always wanted too,
Yeah.
I've always wished my parents had forced me to learn the piano or something,
Yeah
but, uh,
I was one of the forced ones
but I, I'd just love to be able to go to a party or something and sit down at the piano and bang out music
Oh, I could never do that
and,
I was never that brave
but, uh, yeah.
I guess the closest I've ever come to participating in music is singing in the choir.
Yeah,
oh, yeah,
I've, I've done, I've done that at church too.
Yeah.
I haven't done that in a long time.
Yeah.
So, let's see
what .
Well, what kind of music do you not like?
Well, like I say the acid rock,
I just do not
an I don't care for rap music either.
Oh,
that's not music
Uh-huh,
no.
that is not,
I don't know what that is,
but that's not music
If I can't understand the words I don't want to listen to it.
Well, it's, it's, it's not, it's not music,
it's just, it's just, uh, uh, talking in a beat,
it is just, it's not exciting at all
Yeah.
it doesn't, it doesn't give you relaxation,
Yeah.
you can't dance to it,
you can't do anything to it
Right.
But, I, and I love, I like orchestra music too. Like the, Boston Pops or, or anything.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Have you ever been to the, to, to the Dallas Symphony?
Uh-huh.
Have you?
Is
are, are they good?
Yeah.
Yeah,
they're good.
Are they?
I, I have, I have, never been.
And, uh, we went and saw, uh, LES MISERABLES
Oh, really?
oh, the music in that was fantastic.
I, I've heard, I've heard that that is a really,
Yeah.
I heard that was hard to get tickets to.
Yeah,
it, it, uh,
I can't remember how far in advance we reserved, tickets
but it was out, you know, out at the State Fair Music Hall
and, uh it was well worth the price.
Yeah.
Yeah,
that was a real,
Was it?
Yeah,
I, I bet it was,
Yeah.
I, I really bet it was
Is that the only, uh, musical,
do you go see a lot of musicals?
Just, just ever so often you know, a real, a real good one like that one
Yeah.
and,
That, that would be, that would be nice
I went and saw, uh, I think it was, uh, SUGAR BABIES,
that was good,
that had good music in it.
Was it?
How, how,
I can't, I don't know what that's about.
Uh, that was the one with Mickey Rooney
and, uh, oh, what's that real, oh, not real old, my wife she is old too, dancer, uh,
I can't think of her name.
I got it right on the tip of my tongue and can't say it, Helen something.
Uh, uh, uh, I think I know who you're oh, I know who you're talking about,
real long legs, and dark hair.
she's got black hair,
Yeah,
okay,
I know who your talking about.
I can't think ever her name either.
I can't think of it.
Yeah,
that that was, that was,
I remember that being, uh, here a few years ago.
Yeah,
but, uh,
Oh, oh, the last country music,
my, my parents still, uh, really like country, music
Yeah.
and they, they like, uh, they like the Oak Ridge Boys and the Statler Brothers,
Oh, yeah,
yeah.
and, and, uh, well, my, my, my, my parents,
The Blackwoods.
yeah,
my husband likes, uh, country music real well
and he, he likes some of the new groups like Shenandoah,
Yeah.
and, yeah,
he really likes Shenandoah.
Alabama.
Yeah,
yeah,
well, yeah,
Alabama,
Uh,
I think, I think they're a bit over exposed
Yeah
I get kind, of get tired of every other song being Alabama on the, radio.
Yeah,
either Alabama or Hank Williams, Junior.
Oh, I, I've never cared for Hank, Williams, Junior.
I never have either,
and I never have figured out how he won, uh, entertainer of the year for about, three or four years in a row.
Oh
Oh, we, we watch those award shows too,
we enjoy watching the country and the Grammies and stuff
but I just, I just don't care for him,
Yeah.
I just never have.
I don't,
I guess probably my favorite all time country and western song or singer is, uh, probably Eddy Arnold.
Is, is it?
Uh-huh.
Okay,
I, I think, I, I know who that is,
uh-huh.
I think my parents have have, uh, some of his records.
But, uh, I got a, I've got about a hundred and, or had a, uh, some, uh, I sold some of them, I had about a hundred and fifty old seventy-eight R P M records of country and western, songs,
Yeah.
Wow.
Smiley Burnette, I don't know if you were old enough to remember him him.
I've heard the name.
He was, uh, played in the old western movies.
He was the sidekick of Gene Autry I believe
Huh.
or they,
I think his name in, in the movie was Froggy
and,
I've, I've never seen a Gene Autry movie,
had a real raspy voice,
Huh.
and, uh,
No,
I never have
some of those old ones, of course, Bob Wills, Miss Texas Playboys Ernest Tubbs and Red Foley an,
Yeah.
Yeah,
those go back quite a way
Yeah.
I took them up here to Collectors Records and was able to get a little money for them
Yeah.
but, uh, my mother and dad use to, uh, own a restaurant,
It's hard to,
Oh, yeah.
and he had, uh, they had a, uh, nickelodeon, of course, in the restaurant,
Yeah.
and when they would come and change the records the guys would, the guy would give her the old records
Well, that
that's neat.
so, that's where I got my,
that would be great if they weren't too worn out, at the time.
Yeah.
Of course, there's not a whole lot of market for seventy-eight R P M records.
Is there not?
You, you'd, well you'd think there would be.
Well, the problem is most of the record players now will not play them because, you have to have that needle, that, uh, particular kind of needle
Well, that's true.
Oh, yeah.
and, uh, they, just won't play on a modern day, uh phonograph.
Well, that's a shame
because I, I, we go to antique stores a lot
and you see seventy-eights, a, a lot at, at the stores, at record stores,
Yeah.
you'd, think there'd be a market for,
Yeah.
I'm, I'm sure you could find old players for them
but that would cost a fortune, if you could find them that worked
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh.
Of course, they, you know, just don't have the quality of records nowadays either because, you, you get that scratchy sound.
No.
Uh-huh.
Well, those things were big and thick weren't they?
Yeah,
yeah.
You could kill somebody with them
Yeah,
warped real easy.
And the ones you buy,
go out and buy one now
and they're just so thin and, flimsy
Yeah.
and they just, they're not meant to last, at all,
Yeah.
neither are tapes.
I, I we buy cassette tapes,
Yeah.
and machines will eat them,
Yeah.
and so, the best bet, any, these days are compact disk,
those things are practically indestructible
But, I, I guess, you know, the old country and western music you,
back then when I was a kid, there wasn't that much T V,
Oh, no.
so that's all you had to listen to was the, radio,
Radio.
and, uh,
that's just what, just what you had,
plus,
Yeah.
I think it was better back then to,
there's too much T V now
Yeah.
and the radio is, you know, more exciting, really, than, than television,
Yeah.
your imagination
Yeah.
kept
and
it just didn't vegetate your mind like television does
Yeah,
I remember mother and dad always turned on the Grand Ole Opera.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Was it on the radio every week?
Yeah.
what day, what day was that on,
do you, can you recall.
Uh, uh, seems like it was on a Friday,
Uh.
Friday or,

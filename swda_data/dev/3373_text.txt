All right.
What is your favorite show?
Well, I was just trying to think.
When they called, I didn't have as much time to prepare for this as I did some of the others.
Um, I love watching some of the, uh, new, new shows basically.
Uh-huh.
And we, uh, we subscribe to C N N
and we took that,
and we started watching a lot of those especially during the war or during anything kind of thing like the earthquake,
and I have gotten stuck on a lot of this.
The new shows and the stuff that comes on that, that it, you know,
like the, uh, at night the discussion talk shows and things.
Uh-huh.
And we really haven't gotten a lot into the sitcoms that are current, uh, especially with the kids here because we have to kind of filter it before they get here.
Sure.
We have little ones.
Uh, we do let them watch NINE ONE ONE,
Uh-huh.
and  we think that's kind of informative to teach them,  how to handle  things in situations.
It really is.
Uh-huh.
What do you watch?
I watch just about anything,  but  not a lot of,  T V.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
I mean I'll watch, you know, maybe a little while when I first get home in the evening.
Uh-huh.
And I usually watch, you know, the news
and then I'll watch that HARD COPY or or that kind of thing, you know,
Uh-huh.
That's the same thing we do.
and I like the NINE ONE ONE,  and  UNSOLVED MYSTERIES.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
that kind, that's the kind I like really more than,  the sitcoms.
Uh-huh.
I haven't gotten,  into many of those.
Now, I do,  like,
my husband is really crazy about EVENING SHADE that comes on, on Monday evening.
I have heard that's real good.
And I,  uh,
That's,  Burt Reynolds, isn't it?
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
I've heard that.
And I've got to where every Monday I rush around so I could sit and watch that with him because it's really funny.
Now someone told me that
and also, uh, I meant to be trying to pick up on MURPHY BROWN,  because they  said that that was really good this season.
Uh-huh.
Well, his favorite night is Monday night
so we've got to where we will sit,  and watch it on  Monday night,
You've got to yeah,
Uh-huh.
because  that and then that, uh, oh,
I can't even think of the name of it.
Like I say I'm not,
DESIGNING WOMEN is on that night,  too.
Yeah,
and the one with the, the sergeant that married the woman with the kids, Sergeant McGillis .
Huh, I don't even  know.
Sergeant,  uh, MAJOR DAD.
Oh, okay.
Now I,  we've never  even seen that.
Yeah,
that comes on right after, uh, the EVENING SHADE and then MURPHY BROWN,  and  DESIGNING WOMEN.
Uh-huh.
So we always, he watches that
and I kind of I watch the first one then kind of sit in on the others,  as I can.
On the others.
Well, you know, on Friday nights especially, we like to watch TWENTY TWENTY.
Uh-huh.
Or, um,
Uh-huh.
It's kind of a competition on Thursdays between PRIME TIME and KNOTS LANDING.
Yeah.
But, uh, we used to like KNOTS LANDING a lot.
Oh, excuse me just a minute to someone in the
The money is right there on the thing and the coupon.
Well, you can't hardly watch KNOTS LANDING with the little kids around though.
Oh, I know.
That's the thing.
And so,  we,
Except they,   probably are in bed,  by nine.
Uh-huh.
Well, they are.
In fact, on weeknights they are in bed by eight,
but we have just gotten any more that where we just keep it off.
Did you get your pizza taken care of?
Yeah,
he has gone to get it.
Thank you
Um, but I was to say on Saturdays there is absolutely nothing
and that's the day my husband,  wants to .
Well, do you know,
I have picked up a show lately on Saturday night that I've really liked
and that's SISTERS.
Have you watched that?
No,
but I saw that advertised today
and it sounds like it's not fluff.
It sounds like it's good.
It's really, you know, it's really pretty good.
Uh-huh.
I mean,  it's kind of like, you know, um, soap opera  I guess.
Yeah,
that's what they said it was kind of,  a little more  drama to it.
But it's a,
So far it, I've watched it about three times now
and it's really held my attention.
It's been pretty good. Some,  pretty good  acting.
Well, and  and another one now that it's getting darker
and you are wanting to cocoon more,
that they said is excellent is the I'LL FLY AWAY and BROOKLYN BRIDGE.
Some of these,  that are nostalgic.
Now I watched,  BROOKLYN BRIDGE this week for the first time,
Did you,  like it?
but I haven't,
I did.
I  liked it.
Did you?
Well, they said that one and I'LL FLY AWAY are really quality, you know
and,
Now I haven't seen I'LL  FLY AWAY yet.
I haven't seen it either.
I think what I need to do is kind of read to see what is on these days because by the time we get the kids in bed at eight o'clock and then I get my bath it's, you know, it's almost too late to start,  something new.
Uh-huh.
It's nearly,  too late for T V.
Yeah.
That's  the way I am.
I get  in,  from work
Yeah.
and I'm tired
and I sit and watch for a few minutes
so I have to get up and do dinner,  and everything.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
and then we've gotten to where we rent videos for weekend nights.
Uh-huh.
So, it's like,  we are kind of,   tuned out of our T V.
Yeah.
That's us.
If we are home on the weekend, we always watch videos,
so.
Yeah,
well, we do too.
But there are some good shows on.
I, I really probably should watch more of them than I do.
Yeah.
But I like,
I don't know
I, I'm always in to making things
and,  And I don't just spend all my time,
I don't know,
yeah.
There's a lot more to do with,  with your time when you get into it.
and I, my husband, now he sits and watches T V constantly.
Uh-huh.
Well, my, my sister and them and her husband do on weekends.
They don't have children yet,
and they just turn it on when they walk in,
they turn it off when they leave.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
So they are used to  that too.
I could  be around here for hours by myself and never  have it on.
Yeah,
I understand.
Same here.
But, uh,  but there are some really good new shows that I have enjoyed,
and I'll have to watch that I'LL FLY AWAY this week.
Yeah,
it's real good.
And then of course, in the afternoons if I get in from work in time I watch OPRAH, some of those,  you know,  talk shows.
Yeah.
I like her.
I never get in in time for any of those.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, it's, it's nice talking to you.
I guess we've kind of exhausted this one,
but it's nice talking with you.
Well, it's nice talking with you.
Thank you.
Bye.
Bye-bye.

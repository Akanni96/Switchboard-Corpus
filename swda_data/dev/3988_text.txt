favorite type of music or musician or any.
I don't really have a favorite type.
I like, uh, a lot of different types of music.
Do you?
Yeah,
I have a, a tape collection that I like to listen to, uh, cassette tapes
Uh-huh.
but it's pretty varied.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
How about you?
Oh, I, I'm very, uh, I'm very varied as well.
I, uh, I don't think I've ever met a type of music I don't like except for, uh, maybe, you know, heavy metal and that.
That's exactly me.
The acid rock or the heavy metal.
Yeah.
Even some of that I like okay but not, mostly, as a general rule,
Yeah.
I don't care for that at all.
Yeah.
I don't enjoy rap too much, either.
That, that doesn't appeal to, uh,  my ears.
Well, as far  as the rap goes, I think there are a few artists that appeal to me themselves
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
and I like some of their songs.
Oh.
But as, as
I agree, with the general rule, I, I wouldn't choose rap either.
Uh-huh.
But I, I like to listen to, uh, what you might call pop, easy listening country western, jazz uh, classical, um,
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
I, I don't,
I like, uh, like I said, pretty varied, uh, music.
Uh-huh.
I have a couple that my husband really hates that I listen to, like Billy Holiday
Oh
I really love to listen  to her,
Uh-huh.
and, uh, I even have a, a tape of Lady Smith Blackman Bazo
Oh, gosh.
and, well, I mean, they're very harmonic
Uh-huh
they really are.
uh-huh,
yeah,
sure.
So, they're interesting to listen to.
You might try that.
How about you?
Well, um, I listen to, uh, specific,
most, most likely I would be listen to, uh, jazz or classical music.
Um I, in college I took, uh, four years of classical guitar,
and I played in the, in the jazz combo all four years.
I play guitar for the jazz combo.
Oh, yeah?
So, uh, that's where my two, my two listening enjoyments are,
but, you know, jazz can get on my nerves after a while.
Uh, you can't just listen to it, you know, to, uh, especially a lot of the deeper stuff, Yeah, unless, unless you're playing it, *sv
It's too, um, uh,
you have to concentrate on it, it seems.
it just, it just doesn't do anything.
What about the blues or something like that?
Uh, uh, blues are okay.
I, I tell you, I do like, um,
I grew up on blue grass music.
My dad is a big blue grass fan,
and so
Uh-huh.
um, I wouldn't have admitted it when I was in high school
but, I really do like it a lot.
So.
I, I like some of it, um,
as far as like the what they now call country western, it doesn't sound like the old country music at all, does it? *two utts??
No,
it doesn't,
it doesn't.
Um, some of it sounds more like pop music.
Yeah,
uh they've all got, you know, the real screechy electric guitars now.
Oh,
yeah, If I'm going to listen to today's country western, I have tapes of like Randy Travis and Clint Black
Yeah.
and I even liked Jim Reeves you know
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
I, I,
yeah, Uh-huh.
or, uh, what, what Merle Haggard and Faron Young
Uh-huh.
that type of country western is what I, I like to listen to. Uh, Sons of the Pioneers, you know, stuff like that. *all caps for titles
Sure.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Um,  oh, I like sound tracks a lot.
Oh, do you?
Yeah,
it seems like you get a lot of original music that way.
Yeah,
you sure do.
I mean, you know, think about like the Twin Peaks and stuff like that that's just real recent
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
Yeah.
things like that I like to listen to.
Um, I like instrumental things.
Uh-huh.
Um, I have some Spiro Gyro tapes.
Oh, they're great aren't they.
Oh, they're wonderful.
Yeah.
I love them.
I have some dulcimer music.
I mean, like I said, that, that's pretty varied.
Yeah,
it sure is,
yeah.
Al Jarreau, he's somebody I like.
He's pretty, kind of jazz inspired but but still kind of pop, too.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
I like his,
he has a nice smooth voice.
Oh, yeah,
and, you know, what I like the most about him, is, I've gone to see him in concert, and he always, he looks like he's having fun.
Yeah,
sure.
I mean, some people sing,
and they have their faced all contorted, like it hurts them or something
But he looks like he's having a good time.
I mean, he's up there moving around and smiling like he's happy and, and like all he wants to do is, is make the audience enjoy it, too.
Uh-huh.
Sure.
And he, he is real fun to listen to.
Uh-huh.
Um, Bonnie Rait, I like her a lot.
Uh-huh.
Um, in fact, whenever she won her big Grammy
Uh-huh.
I think it was like five of them or something
Uh-huh.
was, was it five,
or.
Yeah,
something like that,
it was last, last, last year wasn't it.
Yeah,
last year or the year before, I can't remember,
but, um, I was listening to a particular radio station
and, and the one D J said, who the heck is Bonnie Rait and why does she deserve five Grammies?
Well, I vowed then that I was not going to listen to that radio station any more, if that D J can make such a

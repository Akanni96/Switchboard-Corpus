Okay,
is it Mike?
Yes.
Do you repair your own car?
I try to, whenever I can.
I've always been a, a I guess a product of a handyman father.
Well, I tell you what, that's, count your blessings because uh, it really is good when someone can do some things to a car themselves.
Yeah.
Yeah.
There's,
although I'll tell you, you know, over the years the cars get more complicated.
Well, that's why I don't do as much as I'd like.
Right,
yeah.
Because they are, I mean they've got, they've gotten complicated haven't they?
Yes.
One of my first cars was a fifty-six Buick. Which, after awhile I could, you know, take it apart in my sleep if I needed to.
Uh-huh.
Is that right?
Yeah.
It, it got to be pretty straightforward to understand
and, now since then, you know, the closer a car is to a fifty-six Buick, the, the more I know about it.
And then start getting into these Nissans and the like
and I just can't keep up.
Yeah,
I, I agree.
About all I ever,
I never was too mechanically inclined,
but I used to always change my own oil and do the points and plugs and,
Yeah.
Course, they don't use, uh, points anymore.
That's right
But, Uh, they do still use plugs.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And, uh, now brakes, I've always done a lot of, you know, changing brakes.
Uh-huh.
And I used to do, I could always do the alternator, you know, and starter.
Yes.
I don't anymore,
but I have on a lot, a lot of times.
Yes,
I understand.
My last car repair actually had to do with brakes
and it's one I did not do myself.
I took the car, my,
I have a seventy-nine El Dorado, took it to be inspected
Uh-huh.
and the parking brake failed.
So I got under there and messed with the, the that, uh, that adjustment to make, to tighten it up
Uh-huh.
and that didn't do the trick
Uh-huh.
and then I got there and tried to,
It probably slipped loose, didn't it?
Well, actually that wasn't even eventually the problem.
I, I did a lot of things that I, I did everything that I could think to do.
Uh-huh.
And, eventually I brought it up to a, a place called Just Brakes
Uh-huh.
and it turns out that there's a,
the parking brake in the rear,
there's a, there's disc brakes
and the parking brake is a piston deal.
Um.
And because the parking brake hadn't been used in so many years, the piston froze up.
Oh.
So they ended up having to pound it out.
And one of them, they, were able to get running, uh, kind of oiling it and playing with it
and the other one they just, it was just frozen solid,
so I ended up having to buy one
and all total, it was just under two hundred dollars, believe it or not, to get all that done
well, it really wasn't quite, as bad as you thought, was it, was it?
yeah,
actually, I, I think it was a lot of money,
but I, I don't, like I
Well, it was a lot of money,
but,
Yeah,
but, I,
it got to the point where I didn't know what was going on
so,
You had to have the help, didn't you?
That's right,
that's right.
Yeah.
Well, do you still do much work on them, then?
I do.
actually that was just a, at, at the beginning of September
and, whenever I can, I do try.
I
actually, I'd say this.
I, I've gotten to the point where I don't change the oil anymore. Only because,
Disposal is a problem.
Well, that is one problem,
but also these, uh, these fast oil change places, you just can't beat them.
That's true.
For sixteen bucks they'll not only will they change the oil in ten minutes, and do a you know, as good a job as I can do, but they'll, uh, lube, too
That's true.
Right,
that, that,
I've, I've quit doing that myself.
Yeah.
And, but one of the main reasons was the disposal of the oil, you know.
Yep,
that's right.
And, uh, but, it,
but, no,
I guess,
that,
and the main reason that it's, it's quick.

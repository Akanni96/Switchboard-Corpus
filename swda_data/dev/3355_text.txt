Okay,
who do you like?
Okay,
What kind do I like?
I like just about any kind except country and western.
Yeah,
that's the same with me, same with me.
It's, it's, course country
and western even I've gotten a little bit used to because it's not like it used to be.
Uh-huh.
Like Clint Black, he's pretty good,
and who's the other big guy?
Well, in Oklahoma we say Garth Brooks
Garth Brooks,
yeah,
that's, yeah, that's the other guy I was thinking of was Garth Brooks.
Yeah,
in fact I think both of them have performed here.
And Kenny Rogers, he's kind of country western verge, you know on the verge of country western.
Right.
Of course, Garth Brooks lives about, uh, you know,
his, his home town is about, uh, fifteen minutes away
Oh, wonderful.
so he is, he's a home boy
Well, then, of course you like him.
That's great.
But, well, I have teen age children,
and so, you know, I'm, hear the, the rock music, not the hard rock, but the, you know, Michael Bolton type stuff.
Uh-huh.
He's my personal favorite.
My son is, uh, twenty-eight,
so, but he, he's real unusual in that, uh,
he likes a little bit of every kind.
He likes jazz and, uh, blues and, and course the rock
Oh, that's good.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
I, I can't say he's real crazy about elevator music, as he calls it.
No,
no,
I, I don't, I don't, actually, we don't listen to any elevator music at my house.
But I've got teenagers,
so.
Well, my teenagers are all gone.
I can listen to any music I want to
Yeah,
that's good,
I, actually, when I'm home alone, which isn't too often, but, uh, our Public Radio Station has wonderful classical music.
It's just very wonderful. Soothing, and, you know, uh, lot of symphonies
and, I just, I love that,
that's probably my all-time favorite.
You know, uh, I, I teach
Um.
and we can have music in the classroom,
but it, you know, it can't be the rock or anything like that
Right.
and I, I find that the classical music is very good for the kids too, it doesn't disturb them and yet it's, it's, it stimulates them,
Right.
Relax,
and and, uh,
Yeah.
What do you teach, what grade?
Well, it's ninth, nine through twelve
Good for you.
and,
A certain subject?
Well, it's, uh, business technology.
Good for you.
But, uh
I was just sitting here while she was trying to find, a, a, another caller, uh,
I was reading
my, my husband and I are taking a computer class at our junior college
oh, boy,
Yeah,
it's pretty good,
it's just a real basic class,
but we're learning a lot,
and we have a home computer,
so it's, it's very interesting.
Uh, yeah,
I'd learn it too.
Uh, back to, I guess we'd better get back to music, though.
Yeah,
the subject of music
I, uh,
do you play any instruments?
I play, I play piano,
I took lessons for thirteen years,
and right now my nine year old is taking piano,
and I just got a whole mess of music,
I, I play the, volunteer to play the piano at the children's Christmas program for the whole grade school, which is K through six five hundred kids.
Ooh, you took on a,
good job.
I did it last year,
and, and, um, I, I just sub at the school,
I don't want to work full time,
so I just sub at the school,
and that's kind of my volunteer thing,
so that, it, it's really neat,
and my older daughter plays the saxophone,
my next son plays the drums,
and my third son just started baritone this year,
and my little girl will start French horn next year,
so.
Oh, well, my son played the sax and drums, my daughter the piano, organ and French horn.
Oh.
So.
French horn is absolutely wonderful instrument.
It's just my favorite.
Of course that's what I played,
and so I'm pushing that on my daughter because I want to play in our city band, not the symphony, with just the city band once we get the, the French horn
Oh, okay.
and I get a little bit more time.
Right now I'm busy chasing my kids.
Yes,
sounds like you've got a houseful.
I do, I do, I love it,
but we have a, a marvelous band instructor,
and, and he's just, he's wonderful.
We have, uh, couple of hundred kids in the band,
our junior high band is just wonderful.
Oh, that's a,
He, lot,
and their concert band,
and then he has a jazz band that my older daughter was in,
and my son will be in next year
that's,
I mean, they play college level music in junior high,
he's that good of an instructor,
and the kids just love him.
Oh, that's wonderful,
So it's really good.
It is wonderful.
I, I have totally, totally a tin ear
Oh do you
and I love music.
I cannot carry a tune in a basket.
I know what I like,
but I
Uh-huh.
you know, and I love to listen to it, love to sing, and I, my kids, when I was little and, they were little
and I was rocking them, singing to them.
Uh-huh.

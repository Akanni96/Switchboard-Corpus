Okay.
Do you work?
Yes,
I do.
I think that's the main change.
What do you think?
Well, I think that's a big part of it
and I, I think it maybe started because women wanted outside of the home
and,  I  almost think with our society and, and inflation and the cost of things it's anymore it's almost couples have to work outside the home.
Right.
That's right.
But, but yeah, I think that's a big change
I'd like to not work.
What about you?
Well, I've worked all the time up until just about a year ago.
Yeah.
And I just,
physically I wasn't able to
and I mean, I love my job.
Uh-huh.
But I have four children,
and that's real hard.
You have children?
I assume so.
Yes.
I have two
and that's been a big deciding factor because I mean I never wanted to be a career woman,
Right.
but as long  as I you know, was going to work I was going to do as, as much as I could,  as well as  I could et cetera.
Right.
Right.
And I, I wanted to stay home when I had kids.
Well, I have two.
I have a four year old and a three year old.
Oh.
And we would like two more
but I,
it's like, we talked. Uh, I don't want two more unless I can quit and stay home and take care,  of them which is,   something right now  financially it takes both people to work.
Right.
Oh.
It's real hard.
Yeah.
It's real hard.
I mean even I,
It's full time work.
Yeah.
It was so hard for me to work full time.
Uh-huh.
Of course, my kids are, are a little older
but then you, then you give up the money.
Yeah.
You know?
You do there's
of course, you know, everything you give up something
but I just,
I,
the kids are so wonderful
Yeah.
.
But I do  think that's one of the major changes. You know,
my mama I remember her being home uh,  you know,  she made breakfast in the morning for us.
Yep.
Fine .
Yep.
I know.
And if  she worked it was part time
and it was work that was done while we were maybe at school,
and she was there when we got home.
Yeah.
You know, and,
Well,  I've decided now in fact, I'm just, I'm substitute teachers aid which is a, afar cry from my travel agent career,  which I loved.
Uh-huh.
But I'm, I'm there in the same school as my children, my two littler ones.
Uh-huh.
And I'm home when they are home.
In fact, I've had an offer to just work the Christmas season at a local jewelry store,
and I'm just really hesitating,  because  I've, I enjoyed my, the first summer home ever,  so like  seventeen years with my kids.
Yeah.
Oh.
Oh.
I mean, well, I didn't have babies or day care or working as a travel agent
and it was wonderful.
Yeah.
My kids  and I, we just had a ball.
See,
and I think,
Of course, their,  their ages, they are almost seventeen well, sixteen, fourteen, eleven, and nine
Oh.
Oh.
and we are just running every direction
and,
But see,  it's such an important time to be home. You know.
It is.
And that,  was important to me enough,
It is.
you know, my husband was raised, uh,
his, his parents were divorced when he was young so his mom always worked,
Always worked.
and he's like  well, you know, what's the big deal about being home,  for your kids.
What, yeah.
Well, as our kids are getting older, you know, he sees it more.
I said, Russ, you don't understand what it was like to have her home or to if you needed,  Mom  at school, you know, she was there to help
Right.
or,  she was  there to take you,
Right.
and, and I want to be able to do those things
so.
I think that, you know, it's good.
You know, sometimes I'll have the cookies ready when they,  come home
Yeah.
and, and a lot of my boys, uh, my older boys' junior high friends will come over.
In fact, everyday,  I've got boys  hanging around,
and it's wonderful
I'm real close to the schools
and, you know, we are just
I, I'm very happy to be staying home.
I think that's wonderful.
But again I miss,  the .
So, where do you see,  us changing in the future?
I don't.
Well, see that was one of the things the, the question I think is,  you know,  what changes do we see
I keep on working .
Right.
and I'm, I'm not sure I, I see it go anywhere.
I think they are still going to have to work.
That we are because it's so expensive.
If we want, uh, extra clothes, the extra car, the extra,
Right.
The thing is, when a woman does work, then there is the clothes to buy,
Uh-huh.
and then  there is the gas,
Uh-huh.
and then  there is the lunches and then the day care.
The day care eats,   me alive.
You must pay for ,
day care.
Yeah.
You know, I pay four hundred fifty to five hundred fifty,  a month  for two kids
Oh  my gosh.
Yeah,
for two.
They would eat you,  alive.
It's almost hardly worth it for you,  to work until they get in school.
I know.
Then you work summers unless you are a teacher.
Are you a teacher?
No,
I'm not,
and I  would love,
you, you, you talked about having the summers off
and I thought, oh, that would be so wonderful.
And I  love the little preschool they are in.
It's wonderful.
Uh-huh.
You know, so I feel good about them being there
but it's still not the same.
No.
It's not the same.
It's just not.
I, I don't see things changing really,
and, and it's terrible for divorced women you know, who are forced to work who maybe don't have a college education.
Uh-huh.
Thank goodness I have mine,
and I could get a real good paying job,  if I wanted  to, you know, in fact, I still have offers, you know, please come back,
Uh-huh.
Please come back to work.
and we'll pay you this .
Sure.
Yeah,
yeah.
And it's been a real tough decision
but I'm very happy to be here with my kids.
My kids, we've seen a remarkable difference in,  now that  I'm home.
That's wonderful.
That's wonderful.
Yeah.
I'm real,
and I'm,
but I've been doing a lot of volunteering at the schools and playing lots of tennis
I like that.
Yeah,
yeah.
I know .
Well, we're working on it.
I'm hoping in about three to five years I'll be able to stay home
and my kids, of course, will be in school then
but I'll,  be there  mornings, I'll be there noons,  I'll be  there afternoons and all.
Right .
Yeah.
I feel like,  that's good
Well,
and I can work part days in my husband's business, you know, so that,  he can afford for us to do that,  you know.
Oh, that would be great.
Right.
I think the, the other thing that, that has changed for woman because we are working is we are having less children.

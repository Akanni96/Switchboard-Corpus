Okay.
All right.
What's your view.
Huh?
What's your view?
Well, I have a hard time thinking that they can control guns. Personally.
Yeah
Yeah,
that's true.
I mean,
You know, even if they give it a shot, it's still going to be black market all over the place, you know,
That's right.
That's right.
I don't know.
Coming from Texas you're probably,
I don't know
I shouldn't make stereo types,
but gun control is probably frowned on quite a bit down there I would think.
Yeah.
It is,
but I'm not really from I'm not really from Texas,
I just live down here now.
I've  I've lived down here a couple years.
Oh, you're  just live down there?
Yeah.
I'm originally from Colorado,
but  yeah
Oh well.
there, uh, there, uh there's a lot of hunters here.
Yeah,
well I know how you feel.
I'm, uh, I grew up in Nebraska
and, and we always use to go out and hunt all the time, you know
and man, there's no way. There's no way I would ever go for a total ban on all weapons.
Uh-huh.
That's just,
I don't know.
I just think, I think it's ridiculous.
Yeah.
I mean,
It doesn't sit with me very well.
I don't know, I, anymore
I keep a thirty-eight in my truck, you know.
Really.
Yeah,
I just about all,
well I live in Minneapolis
and I,
well actually I live in Florida,
but I am staying in Minneapolis for a year
and you know, both areas are pretty crime ridden right now
Uh-huh.
Right.
and it's just, you never know who is out there.
Right.
You know it's just for self protection purposes
and then of course there's the hunting issue,
so
Sure.
yeah
that's good.
What do you do, Jeff?
Uh, I, I'm in, uh, program control for a company up here.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
All right.
We do schedules, for programs, schedule programs.
Yeah.
What do you do?
I'm, uh, researcher of Honeywell up here.
Oh, okay.
So, uh,
yeah.
You guys uh, do you get much of a chance to hunt or anything
or,
Uh, I haven't had a chance to do any hunting since I've been down here.
I don't own a shotgun,
but I'd like to go bird hunting.
Yeah.
You know  that's something I miss quite a bit.
So.
Yeah,
uh, when I was in Colorado we went deer and elk hunting you, you know, quite a bit
Yeah.
but,
Yeah.
All right.
Yeah,
my brother was, uh, a guide for bear and elk hunts out in Idaho for a while and, uh, really enjoyed it quite a bit,
but I don't know.
I guess that what the scale now is, it's zero for, uh, for a complete,
One for a total ban and, uh,
That's right.
I guess I am about eight or nine
Yeah,
I, I agree with you there
Yeah,
no doubt about it
but, uh,
I mean, if they can anyway get it, keep criminals from having guns which they can't
Yeah.
I, you know,  I'm not  for it.
Yeah,
if there's  if there's a way, you know, to limited it to people that, I don't know that
they, I guess they passed a couple of, uh, uh, laws a here while back in some states in terms of a waiting period where you know you go to buy a hand gun
Uh-huh.
and then they actually, uh,
I know it's this way in Florida.
They have a waiting period where you buy one
and that's a week
Uh-huh.
and then they check you out and make sure you don't have a record you know and things like that.
I think that's a pretty good idea.
Uh, and that's,
I don't know,
that's not a bad idea,
but then again you can always get around that.
You could go through the black market like you say.
You know, you always be able to get around
but, uh,
Sure.
Yeah,
it's one of things
but, uh, I don't know.
I guess, I guess some forms of guns should probably be controlled just like I'm not real sure why anybody would need a full automatic weapon.
Yeah,
I don't either
Yeah,
I'm just not,
I think those have been pretty much, you know, banned altogether anyway.
Yeah,
I
There,
fully auto,
but, even well, I mean, a semiautomatic, I guess that's,
It kind of takes the sport out of hunting
Yeah.
Right.
You know, it's like what can you do with that, that you can't do in a self protection situation with like a seven or a twenty shot twelve.
Sure.
You know, you might do the same thing.
Right.
And so it's like, I don't know. It does.
It takes the sport out of it.
For me I would much rather have a bow anytime
Oh, really.
I, I like bows.
You know, I have done some bow hunting
and I, uh, I get into it
and I think it's more of a challenge, you know.
Yeah.
But, uh, I don't know.
I guess it keeps the shell makers in business.
Sure.
But, uh, I don't know.
Anyway, that's about where I stand
Me too.
You, uh,
Yeah,
I am about the same way.
And you, uh, have you eaten yet or whatever.
Yeah.
Is it seven o'clock there?
Uh, yeah,
it's about seven fifteen.
You guys central?
How is the weather up there?
Oh, it's not too good.
It's kind of rainy actually.
Is it?
Around this time of year you expect it up here to get down to about, uh, I don't know, ten or twenty degrees
Right.
and it's been up around forty.
So people are, people are whining about the rain and stuff, but not too bad about the temperature.
Ice is starting to melt and stuff like that
so.
Yeah.
I am just up here for the year
and it's kind of shocking.

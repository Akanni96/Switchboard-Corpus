Okay,
Martin, do you do any exercise?
Yes,
I do.
Uh, I like to, uh, play basketball and weight lifting.
Those are probably the two main things I like to do.
Uh-huh.
Um, so those are more or less indoor sports.
How's the weather out there in Georgia?
Yeah.
Um, in, in, in the winter, you, typically it's, it's probably too cold to go out and do things like tennis.
Um, I like to play tennis in the summer time or in the spring, fall,
Uh-huh.
but in the winter it gets pretty cold.
Oh.
Um, yeah,
so it's mostly indoor sports, I think, in the winter.
Uh-huh.
Um, how about yourself?
Well, yeah,
I'm on a exercise program.
I'm riding my Aerodyne bike, um half an hour every morning,
Uh-huh.
and I'm just about ready to up it to up to forty-five minutes a morning,
and I feel like that's been a real nice exercise in the winter time.
It's it's kind of kept me from getting cabin fever and, um, has seemed to be a real nice aerobic exercise.
Uh-huh.
Right.
Do you do, uh, any anaerobic type, weight lifting or weight training type exercise?
No,
huh-uh.
I, first of all I'd like to get my weight off.
I'm about fifty pounds overweight,
and so I'd like to get the weight off,
and then I'd really like to get into that.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, we have a, my husband and I have a, a, aerobic video that's called The Firm.
I don't know if you've heard of it,
but it's a, an aerobic video with, not necessarily bouncing around and jumping up and down,
but you're using weights,
and that is the most incredible aerobic workout I have ever done.
It's it's  really fun.
Huh.
Yes,
it's,  it's, it's it's similar to aerobics with weights
Yes,
uh-huh.
but it's like low impact aerobics,  just  with weights.
Uh-huh.
Yes.
Okay,
are you familiar with, um, step or bench aerobics?
Um, no,
I mean, yes,
I am,
but I have never done it myself.
Have you done that?
Uh, yes,
I have.
In, in Atlanta that's, um,
most of the health clubs are all,
Oh.
that's the, that's the in thing.
That's the big thing, huh?
At first it was just regular aerobics,
but now bench or step aerobics have kind of taken over.
Oh.
So how is that?
Um, it, they call it a low impact aerobics,
and it's supposed to burn off more calories at the same time.
Oh.
And from when I've done it, it does give you a good, a real good workout.
But only thing I'm concerned about is potential for injury to your knees you know, that and movement of going up on the step you know, that could create a problem.
Oh.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
They, they seem to think that it, it won't,
but you never know.
Now, if, um, playing basketball, are you knees,
do you have healthy knees?
Yeah,
I, I think my ankles probably are my main weak point.
Oh, dear
But, I've, I've kind of taken care of that.
I wear high tops and then also an a support ankle brace which is very stiff
Uh-huh.
and, um, wearing that I haven't had any problems in the past year or so.
Oh, that's good.
Well that sounds, you sound just like my husband.
He he injured his ankle about seven months ago playing volleyball,
Yeah.
and, oh, he's just had a heck of a time getting that ankle healthy.
Yeah,
I.
So that's what he does,
he wears his, his brace and his high tops
and,
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
I did, I injured mine so many times that rehabilitating became quite easy.
Oh.
Oh, .
I mean, it would only take three or four days
and I could play again on it because after a while you just learn how to rehabilitate yourself to play that way.
Wow
Uh-huh.
Oh, dear.
Oh.
But, um, so how, how successful is your exercise video?
It is amazing how fast you take off the inches
Uh-huh.
and I would, once I start my I'd like to do the forty-five minutes a day on the bike for a week,
and then, every other day I'd like to incorporate the video, and then the bike on the other day.
Uh-huh.
But, it is really amazing how fast the inches come off,
and the muscle builds real fast.
Uh-huh.
Um, you can start,
they recommend doing the video without weights for the first month
and then after that you can just start with your five pound dumbbells, and then build up to your, uh, twenty-five pound dumbbells
Uh-huh.
and then you're just doing repetitious exercises throughout the whole video
and it's a hour long video,
so.
So it's a good workout.
It is,
yeah,
I really enjoy that,
so I'm looking forward to losing this weight and being firm and healthy
Uh-huh.
So, in the winter, I guess, there's a lot of,
it's quite cold and snow.
Yes.
Yes.
Now this one has been quite mild.
Um, we could have been out walking throughout the whole winter, because really we only had about three weeks of snow on the ground.
It was quite chilly
but not,

Well, um, I have a, a, a former exercise program.
I'm a graduate student,
and this semester, I'll tell you what, I, it's been almost impossible for me to get, you know, back to regular exercise.
Um, last summer I was a, a swim instructor all summer and, and life guard,
so it was really easy for me to get quite a bit of exercise swimming
and, um, and since I worked at a recreation center I could, uh, you know, use those facilities quite often.
But, um.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
and and it's least hard on your body,
Uh-huh,
and there's and there's no jarring on the.
I,
Pardon?
It's the least hard on your body as far as, uh, impact
Exactly, yeah,
um,
and
yeah,
fluid resistance.
Right,
right.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
How about you?
Well, I do, uh, little aerobics, oh, three or four times a week,
but it's not enough to,
boy if I go, in the summer time I try to jog, jog a couple of miles
Oh, yeah.
and, uh, well, you know, even doing that three or four times a week, when summer hits, that's a hard thing to go out and and go jogging for, uh half hour or so,
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
but so, I'm not quite getting the level that I need to.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Do you, do you kind of think it's a chore,
or do you enjoy it?
I like it.
Uh-huh.
I like it, uh,
part of my problem is I have small children,
so, uh, to do a whole lot just requires a lot of, oh, coordination as far as scheduling and that type of, uh, deal, you know, uh,
Uh-huh.
Sure,
yeah.
Of course, you got a little different direction going,
but, uh.
Uh-huh,
yeah.
Uh, I, um, I used to, uh, I used to weigh, uh, two hundred fifteen pounds,
and now I weigh only about one, about one seventy-five. Um,
so I drastically had to change the way I ate when I, when I first moved to college,
and, uh, I had started weight lifting quite regularly,
and so I got my weight down,
and it's kind of easy for me to forget about it now, because, uh, you know, when I'm not fat like I used to be  I don't worry about it
Right,
you don't notice it  as much,
, yeah.
yeah.
Uh-huh.
Although lately I have noticed, you know, even if I gain, like two pounds, I start, I start feeling it
and,
You feel it, don't you?
Uh-huh.
It's amazing how, uh, how much, uh, it changes,
and I weigh probably about the same I weighed for, oh, I don't know how many years,
but, uh, it's changed places
And things don't fit just quite exactly fit the same.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
But, uh, so, do you do, uh,
in Texas, uh, does
there, probably quite a few facilities.
Yeah,
there are.
Um, I'm living in a dorm right now,
and so right downstairs there's a facility.
And I really feel kind of guilty for not working out more than I do because there's a facility right downstairs where all, you know, all we have to do is, is, uh, run down there
Do you enjoy it,
or is it, uh.
If you can have, find the time it's just the.
Uh-huh
yeah,
I really do, because I like to get, you know, get off alone and just do that for a while,
but that's hard, you know.
Yeah,
it is hard
Uh-huh.
it is hard.
It's, uh, like anything else whether or not you want to sacrifice another half hour.
Uh-huh.
My problem is I don't want to wake up another half hour earlier and do more
Exactly.
Don't get enough sleep as it is,
right
Uh-huh,
yeah,
yeah.
and, uh, kind of have,
if you're having the pressures of school and, uh, everything else, it's kind of,
course it's really, you know,
as soon as you do it, it's really a release.
Oh, yeah.
You feel invigorated
and you feel oh, you feel in a lot better shape just like eating right foods.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
ready to go another twelve hours.
Yeah,
yeah.
If I eat very much sugar, boy, just does something.
Uh-huh.
Do you have to watch what you eat pretty regularly?
I do.
I have to be real careful.
Uh-huh.
I stopped eating meat about, oh, uh, must have been eight months ago.
Did you?
Uh-huh,
completely.
I mean, any kind of meat
or, and I, and I really feel a lot better now.
Makes a lot of difference.
Yeah,
it really does.
Well, there's a lot of fat in meat.
Uh-huh,
yeah,
that's it, I mean, that's about where almost all of the fat comes from
Right.
and so. I found that really helps.
And unless you really like, uh, fish.
Fish is pretty good for you,
but, uh.
Yeah,
I eat that,
I think I've eaten fish like twice since.
I used to eat a lot of fish, too,
but I just tried to cut it all out for a while and see what happens.
Kind of see what happens.
Yeah,
and I like it.
I've tried to do that with sugar
I don't know if I'm that brave yet  .
everything has sugar in it  .
I mean, if you go,
your ketchup has sugar in it.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
Course,
and I like sugar, too,
that's that's a problem,
Uh-huh.
but.
Anyway, well, it's, uh, nice talking to you.
Think we've, uh, covered all the subject.
Okay,
yeah,
it sounds good.
Okay.
Well, good luck to you there in Idaho.
Well, you, too.
Good luck, uh,
enjoy college while you can.
Let me tell you it's, uh.
Well, I'm in graduate school now.
I, I, I kind of feel like I wish I could have gone back to undergraduate now
It's a little different, uh challenge, isn't it?
Yeah.
Yeah,
it is.
Well, it's good talking,
Where are you going studying?
Pardon?
I'm studying speech pathology.
Right.

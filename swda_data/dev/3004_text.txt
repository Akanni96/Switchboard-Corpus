All right.
Well, she lives in Utah,
so.
Oh, uh-huh,
uh-huh.
That's the way we always were.
We always lived away from our family and relatives while the kids were growing up.
Yeah.
So, well, I guess we're going to talk about children today.
Okay,
let's do
So, you ready?
My children are all gone already.
Uh-huh.
They're, they're all out on their own.
So, uh, do you want to start first do you work?
Okay.
No,
I don't,
Uh-huh.
I stay home most of the time
but I know that it's very difficult to, to find good help sometimes when and especially when your, when you want your children to be taken care of.
Right.
Um, you know, there's a,
my neighbor she tends children though
and, and, um, there's a big controversy whether they should have to, um, have a, a a law to have them certified or, or not.
Uh-huh.
And, um, you know, there's pros and cons on both side of that
Right.
because if they were, then you kind of know that they had to go through some kind of testing, or some kind of something to be on , get an okay seal.
Uh-huh.
Yeah,
but yet most of the problems we hear,
of course, maybe that's what we hear about is from organized and approved day care centers.
That's right.
That's right.
But maybe we don't hear about the other ones though that could be.
Yeah.
You know, the individual incidence or something.
Uh-huh.
Uh, now, usually when I have someone tend, um,
my oldest tends for me now if I go somewhere
but,
Uh-huh,
how old, is your oldest?
before,
He's almost a teenager
Oh, well, he's plenty big enough then
Yeah,
he's, he's very good.
Um, but, um, before that I would, I would use, uh, kids from our church,
Uh-huh.
and they did a good job, for me.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
Um, but I've never had to leave them like in a day care center, or anything,
Uh-huh.
and I've been very lucky just be able to stay home.
That's the way with me.
I, I worked four years one time,
but my last two children were, uh, both entering high school age.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, they were, of course, gone while I was working
so it wasn't a problem I saw,
and I stayed home the rest of the time.
Yeah.
I, so I didn't have that problem either.
Now I have, I,
my oldest daughter she has two children
and they've been in day care, uh,
Uh-huh.
she works full time.
Yeah,
that's hard.
It, it's difficult
but yet she's the type of person that, I don't know, if she'd be happy staying at home.
Well, some people aren't.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
She, she surprised me though.
She's done a lot of things that I never thought she would do, you know, with, with the family because she was the one that said she was never getting married and never going to have any children.
Oh, is that, is that right?
So, she is, she spends a lot of quality time I think when she is with, with the children.
I think that's really important.
And, uh, they've used the day care most of the time.
They tried one once.
They had a lady come in.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, she, she also had a small child she brought with her.
And it did not work out. Uh, at all
Uh-huh.
It, she thought it was going to.
She was real excited because it was so much easier than taking the children out, in the morning,
Yeah,
uh-huh.
but, uh, the lady called
and her baby wasn't very old at the time and said she was having trouble.
And this baby is the, is the most pleasant, uh, real pleasant baby easy to satisfy usually.
And, and she was having problems with her,
and so she called and said things were okay, settled down and was all right.
Yeah,
yeah.
Well, my daughter decided to call them and check
and things weren't okay
Oh.
Her, her one son was watching the soapies
which she doesn't allow them to watch the soapies.
Oh, uh-huh.
And the baby was in his crib with the door shut just screaming his heart out,
Oh, dear.
and the baby-sitter was in the kitchen with her baby.
Oh.
And so that ended that, episode,
Yeah.
and she was most upset, uh, over finding this.
Yeah,
I bet.
So, uh, she, they kind of had decided that the day care was better.
There's, uh, more people involved,
Uh-huh.
more than one adult they,
and the age groups are separated Uh-huh.
Well, nannies have been an option, uh,
but I know that at day care they have more of a, a routine like maybe in, uh, preschool would have where they have lessons and, so forth, and so on.
Yes,
story time, uh,
Uh-huh.
and the, this one has been particularly nice.
It, uh, it kept track of what they did,
Uh-huh.
and they would tell the parents what they did that day.
You know, if they said anything or did anything.
So it kind of kept them,
Gave you an idea of what your child, was progressing in or doing.
Yeah.
I I always thought that if you were checking into a day care, that you would be good to get references,  uh, on  people that had been in that day care but was no longer there.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Because they wouldn't have nothing to worry about saying, you know,
if there was a problem they, they would I think be more ready to tell you what it was.
Oh, I think so, because if they were still there, you know they might not,
They may not say anything.
Right,
right.
And, uh, other than how else, how do you judge other than from what others have, uh, what you see, uh, the cleanliness and that type of thing.
You can't really.
You can't really unless your child would be old enough to say something,
Uh-huh.
and usually they aren't at that age. Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
But it would be real difficult to pick you, you know, to find one and decide.
Well, I know I, uh, about three years ago I, I tended some children. And, uh, you know, I, I wondered if I would have to be certified
Uh-huh.
or whether they'd just bring them
and and we got to where, well, we were just friends
Uh-huh.
and so, they said, no, don't do that, we'll just bring them.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh,
uh-huh.
And then if there was a problem
and then we'd sit down, and talk about it
Uh-huh.
but it never happened, to be a problem,
Yeah.
Yeah.
and, and so things worked out okay,
and their kids played with my kids
and it worked out well.
it worked out good.
I'm going to, I've decided I'm going to baby-sit my two granddaughters.
Oh.
Since they'll be going back at the end of the month.
And so, I'm going to give it a try.
That's great.
I, I, I sell Avon and Stanley products,
Oh, uh-huh.
and I've got that worked out.
My husband, he's retired
so he's going to deliver my products
so I'll do my orders and that by phone.
Well, that will be great.
So, um, I'll be able to keep that up a little bit.
Yeah.
But I I think I'll enjoy doing ,
Yeah.
I bet you'll have some great experiences with them.
Yeah,
I, I think I'll enjoy.
Yeah.
I, I guess I kind of miss having a baby around A kid around or something
Sure,
why not. That's right.
Yeah.
Right.
That's right
Well, they do say you enjoy them more,
a some, somebody said if they knew grandchildren where so much fun, they would have had them first
Well, uh, my husband's mother lives right over here,
and she takes care of them sometimes, for me,
Uh-huh.
and, and just is a lovely lady,
Uh-huh.
and I've always appreciated when she's sat with them.
Yeah.
My daughter, always said she would not let me baby-sit because you do hear grandparents complaining you know because they're stuck with their grandchildren so much.
And,
Oh
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
But they're, the ones that complain a lot are the first

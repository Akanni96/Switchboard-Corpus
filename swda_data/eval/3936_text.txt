Have you had any snow up your way?
No,
we haven't had any since, uh, oh, just before Christmas
and, uh we had a lot before Christmas.
Um.
The ski resorts were really
and, uh,
but, now we have, we've had fog, for about forty days in a row and temperature inversion,
so,
but no, uh, no snow.
Um.
The snows all melted off uh,
Well, I talked to a woman who lived up in the hills, uh, mountains in, uh, Utah, I guess this last weekend
and she had, uh, quite a bit of snow on the ground her way.
Uh-huh,
I guess there's different parts of the state of Utah that, that, does have some,
but not,
usually we have up to a hundred and fifty inches up at the ski resorts
and they're down between thirty-eight and, uh, forty inches.
Um
At this time of the year,
and we've been in a drought for the last five years
and this is the sixth year
and it's getting quite serious, as far as water next summer.
Yeah,
well, the weather, uh, here, is always a topic of conversation in Texas.
Right.
But, uh, we have wide variations and have warm weather when most people have cold weather,
but we have our share of cold weather as well.
The, uh, temperature this morning was right at freezing.
It didn't stay there,
but it was right at,
Oh, that's, that's different, isn't it?
Um.
We usually have some of our coldest weather toward the, uh, end of January,
but this year it wasn't bad at all.
I guess that's because we had so much rain.
I know my son was telling me about the rain down there.
He said it was just,
and we read in the newspaper, southern part of Texas I flooded out,
Oh, yeah.
and, uh,
Well, my, uh, my sister lives in Houston
and they, uh, the river there was, uh, in the flooding stage near where her son lives,
and that, uh, caused some, uh, concern, of course.
Oh, boy.
They have a, uh, lake cabin
and, uh, their dock was completely under water on the lake.
Oh, my gosh.
So we really had a lot of rain.
Yeah my son in Plano, he lives fairly close to,
there's quite a wash that goes down, uh, through Plano
Right.
and, uh, there's walking trails on both sides, a walking path,
and, uh, when I've gone down to visit him I've gone on that,
but, uh, that was clear full and up to, up to some of the streets, I guess.
It just
Yeah,
we had a lot of flash floods in the area.
We had a few people who ran into, uh, water and a few fatalities, uh, just a few.
Uh-huh.
Not more than ten
but,
That's funny that, uh, we can't have it in moderation instead of having either a drought or having too much.
Well, the, uh, there's an old profane expression about Texas weather,
it's always too damn cold, too damn hot, too damn windy
Yeah,
well, it's, uh, interesting,
uh,
I'm going down to El Paso next week
and, uh, I was wondering what the weather was,
but I imagine if it's that cold in Dallas it,
Well, El Paso won't be cold.
It's not a, doesn't get that cold, I guess, huh?
No,
it's, it's, quite southern
and it's, it's rare to get real cold in, in El Paso.
Uh-huh.
The, uh, you'll be flying in there?
Yes.
Well, uh, take off is, uh, fun from El Paso because you normally,
the way the winds are you take off right toward the mountain, the Rockies
Yes.
and they're towering above you
and so you circle back over the air and then make a circle around and come back over again.
Yeah,
we're kind of used to that here in Utah,
course, there are mountains,
and I fly into Montana a lot
and we have a,
the mountains are, are really, uh, high
and a lot of places we go in to, you just kind of, uh,
it's in the little valley,
but, I, uh, sure hope we,
we really need the moisture.
I hope we can get, uh, get some.
There's supposed to be a storm,
but it split, went down through, uh, northern Arizona and southern Utah
and they're not predicting any for the next, uh, week anyway up here
so,
Well, I noticed on the weather map on, uh, cable network that there was supposed to be a storm front moving into California and on down your way,
but I guess it didn't pan out, huh?
Yeah,
well, that's, that's what the,
above, uh,
some of it went to the south and some to the north up into Montana,
so that just left us,
we got a high pressure system which been sitting in the
Huh.
and, uh, we broke the record for the amount of fog that we've had, uh, you know
Oh, boy.
airport's been shut down, uh, till about noon every day
and then they seed the clouds, or seed the fog to try to to get the airplanes in and out.
Uh-huh.
Huh.
Well, we, uh, had a bad siege last, uh, Christmas a year ago.
We went up to visit my wife's, uh, sister who lives in, uh, Calgary, Alberta, Can,

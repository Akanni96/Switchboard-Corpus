Okay
Okay
Have you done this very long?
Uh, well, yeah,
for the last, uh, couple of months.
Yeah,
that's the same with us.
Yeah.
Well, what kind of car would you buy?
Well, it's kind of hard to say,
uh, because I don't think we're going to buy another car for about three years.
We just bought, uh, a car, uh, last year and then bought one in eighty-nine
Oh, okay.
and, uh,
wait a minute,
we bought one in ninety.
We've got three cars, of all things.
Uh-huh.
So, uh, probably we'll be in at least a midsize, four door sedan.
Okay.
What kind do you have now?
Uh, we have a, a Mazda nine twenty nine and a Ford Crown Victoria and a little two seater C R X.
Oh, okay.
Uh, it's rather difficult to, to project what kind of, uh,
we'd, look, always look into, uh, consumer reports to see what kind of, uh, report, or, uh, repair records that the various cars have
Uh-huh.
and then, of course, we look into the prices.
Yeah.
And, uh, uh, we're not adverse to buying along in the summer when, when the cars could get to be discounted
because we keep, we've begun to keep them, uh, a longer period of time.
Uh, I traded off an eighty-two Oldsmobile for the eighty-nine Mazda.
Oh, uh-huh.
So, uh,
And did you find that you like the foreign cars better than the domestic?
Uh, yeah,
yeah.
We, we've had thirty some odd cars in our married life,
and, uh, we, we've had a good many foreign cars.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, they, they, uh,
I've been extremely,
we've had three Mazdas.
We've been extremely pleased with our Mazdas.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
We've always bought American made cars, mostly Oldsmobiles.
Yeah,
well, we, we've had, uh,
let's see,
we had, uh, we had a, uh,
let me think.
ause We had a fifty-three
and a, uh, we had, uh, two fifty-threes which is a long thirty minute story
Uh, and we had a sixty-five
and then we had this eighty-two.
Uh-huh.
So we, we really can't complain about Oldsmobiles, really.
Yeah,
we've been real pleased with ours.
I think we've had, one, two, three
Yeah.
and most,
we have a Cutlass, we still have a Cutlass Supreme which is like, a seventy-seven.
Uh-huh.
Then we have a Cutlass Sierra
and we've had the ninety-eight.
Uh-huh.
So,
but I don't know,
we'll, we're going to be in the market for a car, probably in the next year
and the financing is always something we consider, you know, the four percent or when they give good financing through the, the motor company.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
But, I don't know what we're going to buy.
I always thought I would like to try a foreign made car,
but, boy, with all the auto workers being laid off, makes me feel guilty
Well
So,
uh, my son over in Shreveport, uh, sold Porsches, Audis, Mazdas and Volkswagons for ten years
and that was one of the deciding factors in getting the Mazdas.
Oh.
Uh, so, uh, the first foreign car that we had was a, a seventy-seven M G, M G B
Oh the,
Was British racing green, with real wire wheels and a hard top and a soft top.
Ooh, boy.
And, uh, I drove it mostly.
I'll bet it was hard to part with that.
And,
Yeah,
it really was.
My husband was in the Air Force
and we got transferred to Okinawa.
Oh.
So, uh, we had to sell it.
which really tore me up
Oh, yeah.
Because, uh, it, it it was great fun.
And then, uh, when we got to Okinawa, well, we bought a second hand,
we, uh, we decided that, uh,
we had this, uh, sixty-five Oldsmobile
and it, and it was just too big,
so we, we sold it to a fellow who was coming back to the States
and we got a little Fiat, uh, and a, and the little, uh, forty horse power Mazda, four door sedan.
Oh.

Okay.
All right.
That's a real different topic.
I'm not sure I'm familiar with, with what they mean of invasion of privacy.
I know.
I guess that, I guess you consider just things that every day that would, you would think of about.
See, I'm a college student,
so I can think of lots of things that my roommate does that bother me you know, that I think's like is an invasion of my privacy, stuff like that.
Yeah.
But I think it'd be, it is kind of a tough topic.
Yeah.
I think, personally, you know,
I'm, I used to be a college student ten years ago
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
but uh, now I think an invasion of my privacy is when someone calls me on the telephone and says, Mrs Miller, have we got a deal for you.
Uh-huh.
Oh, golly.
You're like, No, you don't, no.
It's like, how do you know my name,
where did you get my phone number,
and why do you think it's a deal for me?
Uh-huh.
I mean, those people, they'll call you any time of the day or night with, try to solicit
Yeah.
and that's an invasion of my privacy, I think.
They call late,
now, I mean, now there's, I heard that they were going to start calling on Saturdays or
Oh, they do already.
See, that's
I would be so mad
Well,
and I've even had the computer generated calls on Sundays, too.
Really.
Uh-huh.
Huh.
But I do know of a way to get around the computer generated calls.
How?
Don't answer your phone, Hello.
The computer's geared to, to start talking to you on the, on the word Hello.
Really?
Uh-huh.
Huh.
I don't know,
I think like things that, that
I think's like privacy is like, just like, not going through my stuff, like going through, just like my clothes or my drawer, just going through my stuff, basically.
Oh, yeah.
That drives me up a wall.
Are you and your roommate a similar size.
No,
see, we're not,
and, uh.
And she still goes through your clothes?
Yeah,
she'll take all my shirts and stuff,
because she can't wear like my pants
Uh-huh.
but she'll take all my shirts and my blouses and stuff.
Ooh.
Man, I'm just glad she can't wear my pants or my skirts or my dresses, you know.
Oh, yeah.
But still, she'll just take them,
and she won't even think about it,
and then, I'll like see her that day,
and she'll be wearing my clothes,
and I'll be like, you know, I don't like to borrow my clothes out, you know,
I really don't.
So I prefer that you just not go in and get them
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
because she doesn't even ask me.
Stuff like that really
like that's an invasion of my privacy, I feel like.
Oh, yeah,
I agree.
Stuff like that,
when you have your door closed, people just walking in and stuff like that.
Uh-huh.
I was thinking like my mom.
I know this,
she would think this is like an invasion of her privacy, is like going through her purse, like if you ever needed money and stuff
Oh, yeah.
we always just give her her purse, you know,
and she'll get it out or whatever.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
I was trying to think,
I was thinking that's the only thing I could really think of that would really be.
My mom doesn't even like for us to go through her cabinets.
Really.
I mean, we're all grown,
all her kids are grown,
and we have our own families
Uh-huh.
and now if we go through her cabinets she's like, Well, what are you digging for?
Yeah,
get out of my cabinets.
Like, what are you doing?
Don't you have your own house to dig through?
That's great.
Yeah,
so, I guess, privacy is really,
and at the work place, I suppose,
oh, well, actually yes.
I can say definitely, privacy at the work place.
Uh-huh.
I hate it for people to open up my drawer to my desk
See.
Yeah.
because that was, that was where I kept all my stuff,
and I could tell I mean, even if a pen was turned the wrong way.
You could tell,
you know you put your stuff where it's,
Yeah.
That would drive, that would, that
It would drive, it drove me batty for a while.
Really.
Yeah,
well, I worked a second shift
Uh-huh.
and everybody else in my area worked first shift
Uh-huh.
and our shifts overlapped
Uh-huh.
so I would come in,
and there would be people sitting at my desk, working,
and I'm wondering, you know, um, what is this,
it's my vitamins,
I wonder, what is, you know, yeah, what is,
why are they working at my desk,
and can I have it back.
Yeah.
Can I have it back soon, maybe.
Then you start missing stuff,
and.
Oh, yeah,
no mommy is going to take the vitamins,
I'm sorry,
I have
That's okay.
See that would, that would make me really mad,
because you can always tell when someone's touched your stuff,
just because,
I mean, I know I have everything like a certain way
and you know how it looks and everything.
Oh, yeah.
Well, you know how you left it the day before.
Uh-huh. child_talking
That would bother me, definitely.
Oh, yeah,
so, that's, child_talking
yeah,
I agree,
it's, it's pretty tough that way,
and, I know, even like with your school books and papers.
Uh-huh.
Do you miss your papers sometimes?
See,
yeah.
Uh-huh.
You know.
That's the only thing I can really think about being an invasion of privacy, like something every day, though.
Yeah,
well, actually I do know,
and I have used it once
Uh-huh.
and it, it really is an invasion of privacy,
but in the library there's a book that you can find out what people's phone numbers are by where they live, their street address.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
And that,
I mean, I've, I've used it once,
